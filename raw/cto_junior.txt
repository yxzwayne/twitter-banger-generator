Damn, is there a better approach then this one from elasticsearch to scale up vector indexing? Assume there's no partition key.

Only one I could find is https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.10602 from 2019.

They generally set num_candidates = 10* k so should be good enough but slower than log N.

Only thing worse then OOP is adding " injectable plugins" to your code base.

Ok so Vllm seems great from the scalability perspective. 

Paging in KV cache in/out can allow inference to scale beyond the memory limits. 

That being said I suspect it'll be slower simply due to disk reads required on OS page faults.

Unnatural here means that the input dataset was generated using some other model instead of by humans.

Original paper link:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09689

This is more validation for approaches WizardLM or airoboros folks follow for generating complex finetuning datasets.
------
WHY are they not releasing Unnatural Code LLaMA???
------
Gary said it better
------
They don't want you to know that synthetic data is the future.

LLMs generating synthetic data to train on drives a huuuge boost in "unnatural" code llama -- the one model they aren't releasing. Surpasses gpt-3.5 and gets close to gpt-4 performance on a 34B model
------
Most people didn't notice this!
------
All the models we release are fine-tuned on sequences of 16k tokens with an increased RoPE theta parameter, allowing them to gain long-sequence processing capabilities at low cost. CodeLlama can extrapolate, and we show improvements for inputs of up to 100K tokens.

Unnatural here means that the input dataset was generated using some other model instead of by humans.

They don't want you to know that synthetic data is the future.

LLMs generating synthetic data to train on drives a huuuge boost in "unnatural" code llama -- the one model they aren't releasing. Surpasses gpt-3.5 and gets close to gpt-4 performance on a 34B model

Most people didn't notice this!

All the models we release are fine-tuned on sequences of 16k tokens with an increased RoPE theta parameter, allowing them to gain long-sequence processing capabilities at low cost. CodeLlama can extrapolate, and we show improvements for inputs of up to 100K tokens.

I am just relying on the implicit checks from module X that is started before our module Y at the runtime. 

The startup order is non-deterministic but is currently ensure due to implicit sorting of the classloader.

engineers hate middle managers but love abstraction layers, what’s the deal with that?

Interpretability is cool

On the other hand, individual influence queries show distinct influence patterns. The bottom and top layers seem to focus on fine-grained wording while middle layers reflect higher-level semantic information. (Here, rows correspond to layers and columns correspond to sequences.)

"a small fraction of training sequences"

Does this give even more validity to the LIMA technique?
------
The influence distributions are heavy-tailed, with the tail approximately following a power law. Most influence is concentrated in a small fraction of training sequences. Still, the influences are diffuse, with any particular sequence only slightly influencing the final outputs.

Influence functions can also help understand role-playing behavior. Here are examples where an AI Assistant role-played misaligned AIs. Top influential sequences come largely from science fiction and AI safety articles, suggesting imitation (but at an abstract level).

Except for bureaucracy, what's preventing drone delivery from going mainstream?

I'd be extremely concerned if my robot colorectal surgeon was written using langchain.

On the other hand, that means I can simply use DAN to convert it to my sex slave.

Don't worry google, the horny anons on /aicg are on it.

Announcing Nous Hermes Llama 2 13b!

This new version of Hermes, trained on Llama 2, has 4k context, and beats the benchmarks of original Hermes on every one we tested, including GPT4All benchmarks, BigBench, and AGIEval.

We have FP16, GGML, and GPTQ weights available!
------
Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b weights have been released.

The model beats its previous benchmarks across the board, with the same dataset + hyperparameters.

The reason our model tested against AGIEval is because Orca paper did, and FLAN (the base of prompts we used like orca did) contains many other benchmark's test sets, and thus was contimated and couldnt bench against them fairly

Announcing Nous Hermes Llama 2 13b!

This new version of Hermes, trained on Llama 2, has 4k context, and beats the benchmarks of original Hermes on every one we tested, including GPT4All benchmarks, BigBench, and AGIEval.

We have FP16, GGML, and GPTQ weights available!
------
Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b weights have been released.

The model beats its previous benchmarks across the board, with the same dataset + hyperparameters.
4k context.  GGML + GPTQ versions ready.

Thanks to our sponsor @RedmondAI for the generous compute.

Treating employees as Q&A bot on slack means that no one ever reads the documentation.

Since no one reads the documentation, the flaws in docs never get detected.

People never develop trust in erroneous docs and just stick to slack Q&A thus eating up engineering productivity.

your github graph is necessary 

but not sufficient. this is why.

also pls don’t do this. like ever. 

or maybe do it. as long as you learn something. and contribute more. net positive.

Unironically, the default expectation in a company should be return a doc link rather than answering the question in slack.

Treating employees as Q&A bot on slack means that no one ever reads the documentation.

I have got blue tick now for a month.

So many large paras can be compressed into small, neat yet detailed flow charts.

Counterintuitively, the compression reduces the loss in this case by making the design explicit.

Unfortunately this won’t fetch the brownie points for words written per quart from the management.

This is the future.  

Seamlessly talking to your PC.  

It's easy to miss the beauty in the backend which enables it to easily detect when you're done speaking, transcribe it, pass it to LLM and give you the response.  

All in milliseconds and with everything running in local.

Here's a demo! Reworked with an event based architecture shared earlier. Some of the events are logging through too!

It's getting uncanny :)

Get a Spark of Inspiration

Open phone GPT,  start talking to it to generate all the code building blocks, keep on adding more and more details and corrections.

Enjoy the sun!

Come back, open browser GPT, paste to VSCode.

This is the future.  

Seamlessly talking to your PC.  

It's easy to miss the beauty in the backend which enables it to easily detect when you're done speaking, transcribe it, pass it to LLM and give you the response.  

All in milliseconds and with everything running in local.

Here's a demo! Reworked with an event based architecture shared earlier. Some of the events are logging through too!

It's getting uncanny :)

Still have some weird state loop things, I'll give it another edit cycle at some point this week

This is the way!

It's now or never!

Time to decide if product mommies get to stay around or go back to Consulting shops.

Yep this is my experience as well. 

All OSS models are great if you want to generate content

but they are not good if you want to do some reasoning/coding

Honestly sometimes bard also sucks in this aspect

Key takeaways:
- Strong correlation between MT-Bench & Arena Elo
- Noticeable gaps between best open vs. proprietary models
- Category breakdown reveals area for open models to improve. e.g., Extraction, Coding, & Math
- Multi-turn helps differentiating chatbots

I still haven't surpassed my weakness where I get bored as the project keeps on dragging on (even if some useful features have to added to it).

Not sure why I have more fun on 0 to 1 kinda stuff than 1 to N irrespective of the team size.

Need to level up to ascend the Aincrad

lol, it might actually work

Good thread on what it's like to be a developer at big companies

His bonus will also be cut btw cause he didn't consider this fafo time in the project's timeline estimates

ok so there was a teeny meeny change that had to be made to UI.
ideally i dont touch js but it was blocking my progress and noone else was doing it (guy who had created it  left months ago and noone has been assigned its ownership yet). so i decided to take it up.

I’ve confirmed that Mark Zuckerberg is serious about fighting @elonmusk and is now waiting on the details (if Musk decides to follow through)

“The story speaks for itself,” a Meta spokesperson says re: Zuck’s IG post saying “send me location”

One good thing that has happened while working on swap lora support in llama.cpp is that I now have enough context to understand 50% of the bleeding edge PRs raised there.

This is a big improvement from last week where I DM'd mr. ggml to ask how to cast C++ tensors
