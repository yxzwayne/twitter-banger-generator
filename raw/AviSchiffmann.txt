"AI as an assistant" is a limited framing

In this decade, hard tech will unlock exponential growth:

• internet > 6 billion people
• energy < $0.01/kWh
• launch < $100/kg

Be ready — you don't want to get left behind.

The Manhattan project didn't just invent the nuclear bomb, destroyer of worlds.

 is very responsive and transparent about where langchain is headed.

In less than two weeks we will have an open-source model running locally that will be better than ChatGPT 3.5

This is pretty crazy.

Note that I do respect langchain’s engineers. Harrison is a fantastic guy, but I will bash your product if you raise that much & don’t at least do one key thing really well.

I’m mostly hyped for GPT-4 fine tuning. Going to be insanely powerful primarily because it’ll significantly lower costs

AI is moving so fast you have to plan for where the puck is going, not what is available now.

Imminent releases are:
- Multimodal (i.e. parse images)
- Great open-source models (LLama 2 today!)
- GPT-4 embeddings

Questions you should be asking yourself:

- What new products… Show more

Your app should be using AI without them even having to do anything. The AI should be the magic behind the scenes.

was there a similar e/acc movement during the OG personal computer days?

Before you start another AI SaaS company, go ask your normie friends why they aren’t even using chatgpt

GPT-4 is truly good enough for the vast majority of tasks. Open source will eventually catch up, and sure you might say OpenAI will always be 2 steps ahead with a better model, but does that even matter after a certain point?

I said it before and I’ll say it again. Rivian has the best web design on the internet

Provides only the information you need. Within a few taps I’m already customizing my car and given the opportunity to test drive or reserve.

Everything is easy to find & makes sense. No over the top animations. Feels native on mobile. Perfection.

Langchain is probably the most frustrating & convoluted developer experience I’ve had. Never again

@hwchase17

we should be supportive of efforts to make LLMs easier to use, I'm confident langchain will evolve… Show more

In less than two weeks we will have an open-source model running locally that will be better than ChatGPT 3.5

This is pretty crazy.
------
Note that I do respect langchain’s engineers. Harrison is a fantastic guy, but I will bash your product if you raise that much & don’t at least do one key thing really well.
------
I’m mostly hyped for GPT-4 fine tuning. Going to be insanely powerful primarily because it’ll significantly lower costs
------
AI is moving so fast you have to plan for where the puck is going, not what is available now.

Imminent releases are:
- Multimodal (i.e. parse images)
- Great open-source models (LLama 2 today!)
- GPT-4 embeddings

Questions you should be asking yourself:

- What new products… Show more

the basis of modern computing was built by people with degrees in actual sciences like math, physics, electrical

People often think that the best way to predict the future is by collecting as much data as possible before making a decision. But this is like driving a car looking only at the rearview mirror—because data is only available about the past.
