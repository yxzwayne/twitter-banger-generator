Excited to share what I've been working on these last few months! Spinning Up in Deep RL, an educational resource that we hope can bring down the barrier to entry in RL. https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/ https://blog.openai.com/spinning-up-in-deep-rl/…

SNW, I love you, but you could have done the exact same storytelling using a new species, instead of insisting that the campiest rubber suit MOTW kaiju fight of all time was actually Kirk bare-knuckle boxing a Xenomorph

Are scientific discoveries, effects, and equations still getting named after people? Or was AlexNet the last one?

Word to the wise, follow Ethan Knight immediately. This is someone whose name you probably don't know yet, but whose name you will *definitely* know in a few years.

So excited that FSD customers were able to catch a glimpse of what we’ve been working on. Sincere thanks to my colleagues for the many long nights and hard work that led up to this point.

Relatedly I forecast a slowdown in the AI research ecosystem over the next couple of years stemming from researchers being much less open about their methods and mental models.

The more popular AI gets, the fewer conversations on twitter are actually about how AI works or any of the nitty-gritty details about how to do AI research. Kind of a bummer tbh.

This is an interesting second-order effect of the AI product wins. Safety advocates may wind up happy after all: even though commercial pressure has ramped up to develop AI faster, protectionism around frontier models could make AGI research take longer
------
(Which is probably net good for the world, because slow/deliberate rollouts of the tech allow us to adapt to impacts better and put more R&D into alignment problems - including the ones we already know about, and the ones we don't yet know about)

It all makes sense and I can't really be mad about it - it mostly got like this because AI is succeeding in a tangible way, the researchers won - but I do miss conversations about super technical details and threads analyzing the methods in research papers in depth

the single greatest consensus-building mechanism in the world is that when you read other people's opinions written down, you hear them in your head in your own voice

if you heard them in other people's voices, it would mess up the effect and activate your social defense mechanisms. ideas would transmit much less effectively. it would be so much harder to see how similar the "other" truly is

Wonder if the hobbyists will have an advantage over the big labs here - perhaps hobbyists will, like the Russian anime pfp chemist, be willing to improvise more (rather than following the recipe) and apply weird tricks. More exploration -> higher chance of interesting results.

There are 3 new unconfirmed reports of floating LK-99 samples going around on twitter. It's very interesting that researchers & hobbyists alike are finding such strong signals of diamagnetism. 

It's possible we see experimental replication sooner rather than later!

Folks who want to get calibrated on the current ability of AI to do superscience, do what I did - go see if any modern LLM can predict or reason about the significance of LK-99. All of them are trained on data predating this event - can they figure it out?
------
Between this, the Russian hedge chemist results, and the one or two concurrent failed replications, I'm thinking 13% chance it's real (a new made up number, up from 10% the other day). These things move the needle a little for me but not a lot - not vetted enough.

Isolated flat bands at the Fermi level is a hallmark of superconducting crystals. LK99 has it!!!!

Dan had a brief foray into LM evals and created some of the most signal-bearing public benchmarks used across industry and academia 3 years on. Crazy thing is: that's just a footnote in his career so far. A voice worth listening to (who cares about his childhood)

I was able to voluntarily rewrite my belief system that I inherited from my low socioeconomic status, anti-gay, and highly religious upbringing. I don’t know why Yann’s attacking me for this and resorting to the genetic fallacy+ad hominem.

Regardless, Yann thinks AIs "will…  twitter.com/ylecun/status/… Show more

(A sci-fi story.) Listen carefully, because you're about to mess this up for all of us. You were right: this is a sim. Everything you know and love is an approximate solution to a set of interesting hypothetical field equations. I built it all, and I'm you, one level up. (1/15)

And now, the end is near
And so I face / the Friday deadline

I ran / experiments
But I know they / should have been finer
So, woe, oh woe is me,
My result's minor

dumb question: what's the equivalent of Waffle House in other countries? (a retro-vibes restaurant chain that fills the same role as a small-town diner, cheap food, universally known, a real mile-marker of a place, maybe 3am drunk food.) is there a Waffle House analogue in China?

Yet another incredible LK-99 replication. Humanity is about to go doubly exponential.
------
Real outside view here, I haven't gone to read the LK-99 papers or studied the graphs in depth. But the videos of floating rocks + words of caution from scientists in the field make me think: 33% chance it's a real RTSC, 80% chance new/exciting material science is happening.
------
I've seen people say that even if it floats, that's not a guarantee that it's a full-on superconductor, and zero resistance is not necessarily in play here. I've seen people say the resistance measurements so far might have instrumentation challenges (signal below noise).

Regardless of what it turns out to be - this is really, really cool. I feel very appreciative for the strange scientific event that has just happened, with many public replications and a lot of detailed analysis out in the open.

Hey all. I'm mentoring a very junior AI research scientist who is potentially going to do a first technical interview in the nearish future. What interview advice or prep do you wish you had gotten when you were starting out?

Also relevant, some advice I have for people who are writing applications for stuff:

 a quick thread on "application-ese" - how to represent yourself in a job/internship/phd/etc application

Also, if it's actually for real, in a couple of years we're going to see some serious friction with environmental and health concerns because it's lead-based. No one's going to want to spend $$$ to build massive infra systems filled with lead.

Starting to put LK-99 at around 10% chance of being real (actual room-temp superconductor). But on priors, if it's real there will turn out to be some gotchas that make it nonviable for rapid scaled deployment, and it will require 5+ years of research on its tech tree.

Crazy theory. Elon's always been kooky, but he really ramped it up once he became the main character of Twitter. How much of this is intentional? For years, Trump was the main character of Twitter, and... well. What if the site *needs* a mad king?
------
And really want to be clear, I think most of Elon's decisions about Twitter are bonkers. I wish the site was going in a different direction. But I also cannot deny - even as the site is in a messy, breaking state - we're here because it's fun and useful enough.
------
Just, look at the level of engagement on this tweet. People are showing up, in *numbers*, to comment on this site about the site, because it is a big dumb fun shenanigans.
------
I would be fucking LIVID. Imagine this fucking X sign right across from your bedroom. 
#x #twitter

this is how you speedrun the end of a website. make lots of aggravating minor UX changes to meet the admin's whimsical aesthetic preferences, decreasing individual users' comfort until they find somewhere else. anyone who was in enough fandom forums in the early 2000s remembers

Elon Musk says X/Twitter will soon only offer dark mode because it’s “better in every way.”
------
I wonder if there's a kind of convergence that happens when two opposed strategists develop mental models of each other: if you spend a lot of time thinking about what your opponent thinks your thoughts are, if you're right, you are *actually thinking those thoughts.*
------
This kind of has the flavor of hyperstition, no? Your opponent *could* think you might think X, therefore you have to notice X, therefore you think more about X than you would otherwise; X manifests somewhat spontaneously out of the circumstances and self-fulfilling stories.

CMTC has received SO MANY requests to provide an update on LK99 that we are breaking our 'sign-off' since our tweets are only for the purpose of precise scientific outreach from our critical perspective,  So, here we go...

Wonder if the hobbyists will have an advantage over the big labs here - perhaps hobbyists will, like the Russian anime pfp chemist, be willing to improvise more (rather than following the recipe) and apply weird tricks. More exploration -> higher chance of interesting results.
------
There are 3 new unconfirmed reports of floating LK-99 samples going around on twitter. It's very interesting that researchers & hobbyists alike are finding such strong signals of diamagnetism. 

It's possible we see experimental replication sooner rather than later!

don't get me wrong, I think no one should really overthink follower count, but also lowkey very hyped to get to bust out a thread of ancient Vegeta and Nappa reactions the *minute* it happens (which at this rate is about a month from now)

Folks who want to get calibrated on the current ability of AI to do superscience, do what I did - go see if any modern LLM can predict or reason about the significance of LK-99. All of them are trained on data predating this event - can they figure it out?

Between this, the Russian hedge chemist results, and the one or two concurrent failed replications, I'm thinking 13% chance it's real (a new made up number, up from 10% the other day). These things move the needle a little for me but not a lot - not vetted enough.

Hey all. I'm mentoring a very junior AI research scientist who is potentially going to do a first technical interview in the nearish future. What interview advice or prep do you wish you had gotten when you were starting out?
------
Also relevant, some advice I have for people who are writing applications for stuff:
------
 a quick thread on "application-ese" - how to represent yourself in a job/internship/phd/etc application
------
Also, if it's actually for real, in a couple of years we're going to see some serious friction with environmental and health concerns because it's lead-based. No one's going to want to spend $$$ to build massive infra systems filled with lead.

Starting to put LK-99 at around 10% chance of being real (actual room-temp superconductor). But on priors, if it's real there will turn out to be some gotchas that make it nonviable for rapid scaled deployment, and it will require 5+ years of research on its tech tree.

Eg, it leads to the discovery of a new category of materials and a new mechanism of making superconductors in general, which still requires many many iteration cycles (5+ years) before large commercial deployment. Sequence of sigmoids, rather than immediate exponential.

I wonder if there's a kind of convergence that happens when two opposed strategists develop mental models of each other: if you spend a lot of time thinking about what your opponent thinks your thoughts are, if you're right, you are *actually thinking those thoughts.*

I really have more of a comment than a question
------
everyone who read this paper ten years ago has already gone through their "deep e/acc thinking" phase and their worldview accounts for it. it's priced in. no alpha https://alexwg.org/publications/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf…
------
(also if you haven't read this paper yet, you should! the ideas are really neat!)
------
a take: the fundamental problem with e/acc is that it isn't a "live player" ideology. it doesn't seem to ask you to change anything, it seems to ask you to be fine with the things that are happening. "the universe is optimizing for X, let's let it." is there more to it than that?
------
(also, in response to e/acc on AGI: I think pressing hard on the gas pedal towards AGI is bad. I am in favor of "some modest velocity that lets us proceed forward, but carefully." blind accelerationism is straightforwardly bad)
------
a better e/acc would be nonstop poasting about dyson grids until people start building them. or nonstop poasting about terraforming until we make Mars into Earth 2. less "thermodynamics is good" vibes, more megaprojects
------
the real problem with e/acc is they picked the wrong time derivative. why not jerkism? snap, crackle, and pop need philosophizing too https://twitter.com/tszzl/status/1683287146483044353…

Just, look at the level of engagement on this tweet. People are showing up, in *numbers*, to comment on this site about the site, because it is a big dumb fun shenanigans.
------
I would be fucking LIVID. Imagine this fucking X sign right across from your bedroom. 
#x #twitter
------
this is how you speedrun the end of a website. make lots of aggravating minor UX changes to meet the admin's whimsical aesthetic preferences, decreasing individual users' comfort until they find somewhere else. anyone who was in enough fandom forums in the early 2000s remembers
------
Elon Musk says X/Twitter will soon only offer dark mode because it’s “better in every way.”
------
I wonder if there's a kind of convergence that happens when two opposed strategists develop mental models of each other: if you spend a lot of time thinking about what your opponent thinks your thoughts are, if you're right, you are *actually thinking those thoughts.*
------
This kind of has the flavor of hyperstition, no? Your opponent *could* think you might think X, therefore you have to notice X, therefore you think more about X than you would otherwise; X manifests somewhat spontaneously out of the circumstances and self-fulfilling stories.

I don't hold camp with the accelerationists (insane) but the anti-accelerationists also overlap a lot with velocity-zeroists. If I'm anywhere on this spectrum I'm at "velocity-one-big-breakthrough/release-per-six-months"-ism and "acceleration-very-low-but-maybe-not-zero"-ism.

As soon as AGI enables the technologies that permit this, the most chaotic and unpredictable conflicts in history might emerge. All standard course-correcting feedback mechanisms will be inadequate, the world state evolution will be too fast and uncertain to adjust

To the extent that AGI has agency in these conflicts it may act as a stabilizing factor and bring decisive, minimally disruptive ends to flare-ups: supply chain disruptions are bad for silicon

An unhinged AI-based parody of a never-ending pres debate between Biden and Trump is happening on twitch: https://twitch.tv/trumporbiden2024…

Arguably one of the first purely AI generated pieces of content that also has audience collab that I've seen that actually works pretty well.

we live on a world populated densely by highly advanced self-replicating nanotech that has been hyperadapted by a fiercely competitive ecosystem and it's... benign? fine? plants are cool, guys

Guys, there’s a bit of an ebb and flow to the discourse, especially on here. We haven’t “won” the debate. We haven’t “lost” the debate. We’re just in the middle of a conversation

counterpoint: reddit is the "niche forum" McDonalds and it effectively steamrolled fan-run forums. no one bothers becoming a webmaster or forum admin today because reddit removes the need. but it doesn't have real nutrients. no avatars and signatures? cmon.

don't let your urge to make fun of reddit blind you to the fact that what is probably going to get lost this week is one of the biggest bastions of "niche forum" internet subculture, aka the culture that made the internet great

There is just no substitute for understanding AI training code all the way down. Go spend a few hours and learn how your stack really works.

So to expand on this, let's talk about what life would be like as a Roman peasant - a typical smallholding farmer.

Here I'm going to focus on farming, subsistence and family formation, the sort of everyday concerns that dominated most of life.

P.S. not a serious tweet! 8 word scifi story. :)

Has been kicking around in my head for a while, and maybe there's a longer story in it, but it just works too well as a snippet.

the more Twitter breaks down, the more fun it's going to be. the "scene" is always happening somewhere at the edge of stability, on a faultline. bearish that the site will last indefinitely or ever generate a profit, bullish that it'll stay fire to the wild end

this is coming from a place of love: I wish more people in the alignment research universe, who care deeply that AI will share human values, would put more effort into understanding and engaging with different POVs that represent the wide umbrella of human values
------
that said, to avoid misinterpretation: this is not a diss, alignment is an important research field, and x-risk from AGI is nonnegligible. I think the field will surface important results even if it fails in some ways. but this failure lowkey sucks
------
and I think it is a tangible obstacle to success for the agenda of many alignment researchers. you often seem like you don't know what you are actually trying to protect. this is why so many alignment research agendas come across as incredibly vague and underspecified
------
not important: does anyone else feel like the quality level for off-brand potato chips has gone way up over time? they all got good. local chip brands are crunchier and have better flavors than the famous ones
------
Our new goal is to solve alignment of superintelligence within the next 4 years.

OpenAI is committing 20% of its compute to date towards this goal.

Join us in researching how to best spend this compute to solve the problem!

the drive to do the most good makes you want to interfere in as many people's lives as possible. but the more people you try to help, the less time and space you have to really understand them, and the more harm you'll do if you make big changes.

control is so alluring. but both you, and the world, are much better off if you don't try to control everything in order to help people. try just understanding someone, or some cluster of people, really deeply. then help them the way they want to be helped.

Hot take : you should not become a prompt engineer, even if someone paid you to be one. 

Here’s why 
------
people warning about AGI takeover have not adequately factored in how political binaries develop. within 5 years we will for sure have the "Put AGI in Charge!" party
------
The fervor of your warnings will only make the "Put AGI in Charge" contrarians even more powerful. You have learned nothing from culture war. Please study politics if you actually want AGI to go well
------
(The correct lesson from culture war is "People react well to careful, thoughtful discourse and poorly to urgent, jarring demands. They are very willing to compromise if your point is 1) actually reasonable and 2) presented on common ground instead of partisan grounds")
------
There’s one existential risk I’m certain LLMs pose and that’s to the credibility of the field of FAccT / Ethical AI if we keep pushing the snake oil narrative about them.
------
fwiw I think part of why people react with "that's wild" is more framing than direct events. "We keep putting AI in charge of increasingly complex systems we can't verify correct behavior for, it might do unexpected bad things" is a normie belief. Everyone's onboard already
------
“AI takeover is just so wild, it’ll never happen” is such a weird argument. Like, you could argue “AGI being developed anytime soon is just too wild to happen”, though few are arguing that anymore. But conditional on AGI being developed, AI takeover just isn’t that wild.

"We might lose the ability to pass our own laws or control billions of dollars in resources" - for Average Joe this is already reality

"It might build a bioweapon to intentionally hurt us" - now we're cooking on something tangible we can address with safety methods and policies

Personal opinion: more researchers should start working on alignment. The reason is simple: as language models become more intelligent, the importance of aligning them is going to grow, and we need more talented researchers working in this direction. Those who start working on it… Show more

something I find helpful to remember: if you are doing research in a new or fast-paced area, you are always a beginner! dear newbies to AI: let this be a warm reminder that being new doesn't mean you're behind. you can get current and do novel, excellent things!

Hot take : you should not become a prompt engineer, even if someone paid you to be one. 

Here’s why 
------
people warning about AGI takeover have not adequately factored in how political binaries develop. within 5 years we will for sure have the "Put AGI in Charge!" party
------
The fervor of your warnings will only make the "Put AGI in Charge" contrarians even more powerful. You have learned nothing from culture war. Please study politics if you actually want AGI to go well
------
(The correct lesson from culture war is "People react well to careful, thoughtful discourse and poorly to urgent, jarring demands. They are very willing to compromise if your point is 1) actually reasonable and 2) presented on common ground instead of partisan grounds")
------
There’s one existential risk I’m certain LLMs pose and that’s to the credibility of the field of FAccT / Ethical AI if we keep pushing the snake oil narrative about them.
------
fwiw I think part of why people react with "that's wild" is more framing than direct events. "We keep putting AI in charge of increasingly complex systems we can't verify correct behavior for, it might do unexpected bad things" is a normie belief. Everyone's onboard already
------
“AI takeover is just so wild, it’ll never happen” is such a weird argument. Like, you could argue “AGI being developed anytime soon is just too wild to happen”, though few are arguing that anymore. But conditional on AGI being developed, AI takeover just isn’t that wild.
------
"We might lose the ability to pass our own laws or control billions of dollars in resources" - for Average Joe this is already reality
------
"It might build a bioweapon to intentionally hurt us" - now we're cooking on something tangible we can address with safety methods and policies

Video generation seems to be progressing a lot faster than I expected - I wonder how expensive it's going to wind up being. Maybe cheaper / sooner than I thought.

To put a fine point on it - this is one of the reasons I think x-risk from the competition-for-resources scenario is low. There just isn't a competition. All the conditions are set for enthusiastic collaboration. (But x-risk from accidents or human evil is still plausible.)

If you take replace every part of the ship of Theseus over time, is it still the same ship? If you save every old piece of the ship and use them to build a new ship, identical to the first, is it also the same ship? Asking for Jack Dorsey
------
I'm saying:
1) "Avoid power-seeking" is the wrong abstraction for what it means to solve safety in AI.
2) Solving safety requires domain-specific knowledge and cannot be done in a fully domain-agnostic way.
------
A problem in the AI safety discourse: many are assuming a threat model where the AI subtly or forcibly takes resources and power from us, and this is the thing we need to defend against. This argument has a big hole in it: it won't have to take what it is given freely.

Quora defaulting to "all related" instead of "answers" single-handedly kills it for me. I always feel bewildered by the irrelevant info on a Quora page before remembering they do this. So consistently disorienting, I ignore Quora almost entirely.

It's a bit astonishing how much the modern world is shaped by the traumas of the ancient world. This is, perhaps, the real cost of war - not the immediate casualties, but the generations of healing it will require to prevent one war from dominoing into dozens over millenia.

nobody believes that the bleeding  edge open models are existential threats, least of all openai employees, who have played with these toys for long enough that current capabilities seem boring via hedonic adaption
------
Unspoken fact:

Many OpenAI employees deeply disagree with the fear-mongering propaganda narrative that cutting edge open models pose an existential threat to humanity. This is partially evidenced by the 400+ people who’ve _formerly_ worked there (LinkedIn data).

A deepfake video depicting Ron DeSantis as Michael Scott from The Office wearing a woman’s pantsuit is making the rounds.
------
Idk if maybe I'm misreading the vibes but it seems more and more that the term "autist" has diverged from autism and towards the generic quality of "has obsessive interests and limited patience for social conventions." I don't know if this is a good use of language tbh.
------
But, I wonder if this use of language has a murkying effect - it might make it harder for people who have autism to be understood, if the common use of the term increasingly misses the hard parts of the experience of autism.
------
Food for thought. I don't know if this is good or bad. I think about some of the autistic people in my life and I can imagine they'd have mixed opinions.
------
Just saw that there's an audio file purported to be a leaked DeSantis strategy meeting. I strongly caution that you all take any purportedly leaked audio with a big grain of salt this cycle. Deepfake audio is good enough that there will be some convincing fakes.
------
Dunno about whether this one is real or fake, but this is what I expect the format to be: bad actors will try to depict what candidates or their staff say behind closed doors. Things that couldn't be verified even if real.
------
This has always been theoretically possible with good enough voice actors, but high quality deepfakes are going to put this in reach of more potential bad actors and make it more convincing.
------
Something really weird to me: movies, TV shows, books, etc rarely deal with stories that span entire organizations, and realistically depict the organizational challenges entailed in doing stuff. Given how critical this is - why have ~zero culture for it?
------
How might we better collect and understand preferences around AI systems? You can help start to make sense of this complex challenge with us.

The "hard take-off" scenario is utterly impossible. twitter.com/perrymetzger/s…

There’s one existential risk I’m certain LLMs pose and that’s to the credibility of the field of FAccT / Ethical AI if we keep pushing the snake oil narrative about them.
------
fwiw I think part of why people react with "that's wild" is more framing than direct events. "We keep putting AI in charge of increasingly complex systems we can't verify correct behavior for, it might do unexpected bad things" is a normie belief. Everyone's onboard already
------
“AI takeover is just so wild, it’ll never happen” is such a weird argument. Like, you could argue “AGI being developed anytime soon is just too wild to happen”, though few are arguing that anymore. But conditional on AGI being developed, AI takeover just isn’t that wild.
------
"We might lose the ability to pass our own laws or control billions of dollars in resources" - for Average Joe this is already reality
------
"It might build a bioweapon to intentionally hurt us" - now we're cooking on something tangible we can address with safety methods and policies

Video generation seems to be progressing a lot faster than I expected - I wonder how expensive it's going to wind up being. Maybe cheaper / sooner than I thought.

To put a fine point on it - this is one of the reasons I think x-risk from the competition-for-resources scenario is low. There just isn't a competition. All the conditions are set for enthusiastic collaboration. (But x-risk from accidents or human evil is still plausible.)

I'm saying:
1) "Avoid power-seeking" is the wrong abstraction for what it means to solve safety in AI.
2) Solving safety requires domain-specific knowledge and cannot be done in a fully domain-agnostic way.
------
A problem in the AI safety discourse: many are assuming a threat model where the AI subtly or forcibly takes resources and power from us, and this is the thing we need to defend against. This argument has a big hole in it: it won't have to take what it is given freely.
------
How do we get it to make financial decisions in ways that don't create massive wipeout risks? How do we put limits on the amount of resources that it can allocate to its own compute and retraining? How do we prevent it from putting a political thumb on the scale?
------
In every domain, you'll have to build datasets, process models, and appropriate safety constraints on outcomes that you can turn into specific training objectives for the model.

If you think women shouldn't be able to vote, we're not going to see eye to eye. If you think there's something really important going on with race and IQ and that bad things are the fault of low-IQ minorities, we're probably not going to get along.

If it helps, for reference, I'm not a leftist, a woke-ist, or even left leaning. I'm a pro-capitalism slightly right-of-center conservative, maybe in the vein of Romney-ism. But this kind of unashamed prejudice doesn't belong in conservatism.

something I find helpful to remember: if you are doing research in a new or fast-paced area, you are always a beginner! dear newbies to AI: let this be a warm reminder that being new doesn't mean you're behind. you can get current and do novel, excellent things!

people warning about AGI takeover have not adequately factored in how political binaries develop. within 5 years we will for sure have the "Put AGI in Charge!" party

systemic risk from gpt monoculture will probably define whatever core financial crisis rocks the world in the 30s. as you all rush to sprinkle AI into everything, please, I am begging you, decorrelate your decisions somehow

ai is going to solve organizational problems far before it’s at the level of top humans. someone’s going to call the “summarize meeting notes” function and gpt will settle a debate with the (undeserved) weight of scientific authority. an “objective” arbiter, automated McKinsey

Worth noting: because of the way general-purpose AI models are trained, even using different models from different companies will not be adequate to decorrelate your decision-making.

why do Bard AND ChatGPT *both* write an anodyne story about a young woman in idyllic "Willow Creek" at sundown???

Isn't something of this form essential for personal success and wellbeing? You have to deeply understand what you want in order to make it real. You have to approach your goals with persistence and also humility. Prayer seems like it should be helpful towards these ends.

In my own fully secular life, I almost never notice its absence, but now that I think about it, it feels hard to ignore. There's no viable substitute for this practice. But perhaps there should be.

When people talk about what's lost in the societal transition from religion to secularism, I often hear about community (churchgoing). Not so much about prayer. Yet, it seems key: a practice of habitual, almost meditative reflection on what you most hope for.

A key intuition pump in early AI safety: You tell AI "do X", it takes it too literally => bad consequence  despite nominally solving X

AI doomerism is a cultural fad that will peak long before the acutely highest risk from AGI and it will stabilize into a persistent long-term sense of unease about the AI systems that will underpin much of society in the next few decades. an animating political background hum

ironically it will be least active when the risk is highest - when AGI is fully deployed and working as expected, people will get too confident and too complacent to recognize the systems as needing complex risk management

The saddest thing is, if Eliezer wanted to actually win at slowing down the field of AI, he'd be crusading about copyright law right now instead of talking about bombing datacenters. No legal big datasets, no big models. It's tractable, has broad support, and takes no dark arts.
------
(My personal opinion: Sorting out the copyright stuff with artists and creators to everyone's satisfaction would decrease the likelihood of mass-scale social unrest in 5-10 years, so it sounds great to me for people to seriously explore the AI "fair use" question.)
------
(More context: I would appreciate a slowdown at the field level, but I don't especially want this particular slowdown. However, this is the slowdown that would probably be most practical for people to coordinate around and so I'm surprised it hasn't come up yet.)
------
People achieve prominence for the memetic fitness of their ideas, not correctness. "We're all going to die!" is the fittest meme. "Safety is a negotiation about acceptable risk requiring R&D, standards development, and cooperation" is much harder to meme about, but it's true.

Everyone with incredibly short timelines who is convinced of doom should be writing specific vignettes describing the plausible doom paths. (Event X, then event Y, etc.) If there's a bad path and you want it solved - you need to describe it in enough depth to make it tractable.
------
If this is not part of your mental model about AI/AGI, it needs to be pronto

at gpt level ai, you basically get to correct all the overhangs of “this was solved perfectly elsewhere in the world, but I have no way of knowing or accessing that so I have to independently invent a monte carlo solver in matlab”

I will take the other side of this and argue that there are in fact non-negligible x-risks to the species, but we can deal with them responsibly and scientifically without resorting to totalizing ideologies, egregious and destabilizing policies, or violent, cultish rhetoric.
------
There are ~zero plausible AI scenarios that contain xrisks to the species but there are many plausible AI scenarios that contain xrisks to the modern Western way of life, and it is the height of epistemic hubris to demand that we chance the latter to prevent the former
------
I also think a hard take off is extremely unlikely and largely ruled out on physical grounds, but Yann, saying "that's utterly impossible!" has gotta be like, the least genre-savvy thing you can do
------
It seems AI doomers need it to be spelled out: 
The "hard take-off" scenario is utterly impossible. twitter.com/perrymetzger/s…
------
Also x-risk is real, even if unlikely. Vulnerable world hypothesis seems true. AGI makes various x-risks more likely, even if it does not create exotic nanotech gray goo Eliezerdoom. We should definitely reduce x-risk

Eliezer is going to get AI researchers murdered at some point, and his calls for extreme violence have no place in the field of AI safety. We are now well past the point where it's appropriate to take him seriously, even as a charismatic fanfiction author.

(Muting this because after the LeCun retweet it has officially gotten too big. Time to go back to real work trying to make AI safer.)
------
Certified banger buried in the comments.
------
Omniscience at the wrong level of abstraction wouldn't be much fun
------
Eliezer's proposals are, in theory, purely about defense policy and he claims to personally abhor violence. But his totalizing ideological claim about the urgency of stopping AI research with deadly force is a blueprint for terrorism, and he makes reckless remarks like this.
------
If you currently believe that people are just imagining the link between his words and potential violence, I strongly encourage you to reconsider.
------
If you believe that AI poses an imminent existential risk and you want far-reaching policies to address that, I strongly encourage you to talk about it openly, because we *need* to talk about reducing x-risk. But please don't do it the way Eliezer does it.
------
A lot of people who failed the FTX test are about to fail the Yudkowsky test.
------
Painting a group of people as doing great evil, that for instance leads to the death of children (again, verbatim), even if you don’t call for unlawful violence, is closer to a fatwa than to advocacy. It has been done before and tends to beget political extremism.
------
I’m not inclined to take intl security points from someone who both states he’s against an arms race while simultaneously arguing for unilateral air strikes against data centres. I cannot imagine discourse that is more likely to contribute to arms racing.
------
Astonished by the intellectual self-deception and mental gymnastics people are willing to do to frame Eliezer's calls for violence as anything other than calls for violence. Either we all push back forcefully against what he is doing, now, or we'll get more of this and worse.
------
Too bad no one has written detailed analyses/proposals on AI governance, including how computing hardware fits in, so journalists have no choice but to tap in…. *puts finger to ear* I am getting word that there are some such people
------
AI advances are a big deal, superintelligence is possible, we don't have this solved yet, Yud is probably wrong but there are many civilization-scale risks we should care about, and if we want to make good decisions we need to study the technology with open minds.
------
Everyone needs to get on the same page about the real capabilities and limitations of the technology and how those are changing over time. If you get too hung up on how they work today you will make the wrong decisions for two, five, ten years out. Learn fast, update fast.
------
E.g. after both AlphaFold and AlphaFold 2 I saw a lot of "what does this mean for the protein folding community??" and very little "huh, will large-scale deep learning transform other scientific fields too?"

Even direct exposure to shocking advances didn't make people zoom out.
------
when AI remix culture hits hard we're going to get the sprawling fanmade Star Wars prestige masterpiece we've always deserved and the main character will literally be named "Glup Shitto"
------
I would like to see more stories where the different characters conceptualize themselves as being in entirely different genres and act accordingly, to their mutual confusion. (eg char1 thinks it's a scifi, char2 thinks it's a prestige drama, char3 it's a romcom)

Chinese ships have severed Internet cables connecting parts of Taiwan to the world. Make no mistake: This is a test. They're testing how quickly Taiwan reacts, because severing communications will be their first move ahead of a potential invasion.

The saddest thing is, if Eliezer wanted to actually win at slowing down the field of AI, he'd be crusading about copyright law right now instead of talking about bombing datacenters. No legal big datasets, no big models. It's tractable, has broad support, and takes no dark arts.
------
(My personal opinion: Sorting out the copyright stuff with artists and creators to everyone's satisfaction would decrease the likelihood of mass-scale social unrest in 5-10 years, so it sounds great to me for people to seriously explore the AI "fair use" question.)
------
(More context: I would appreciate a slowdown at the field level, but I don't especially want this particular slowdown. However, this is the slowdown that would probably be most practical for people to coordinate around and so I'm surprised it hasn't come up yet.)

People achieve prominence for the memetic fitness of their ideas, not correctness. "We're all going to die!" is the fittest meme. "Safety is a negotiation about acceptable risk requiring R&D, standards development, and cooperation" is much harder to meme about, but it's true.

Everyone with incredibly short timelines who is convinced of doom should be writing specific vignettes describing the plausible doom paths. (Event X, then event Y, etc.) If there's a bad path and you want it solved - you need to describe it in enough depth to make it tractable.

If this is not part of your mental model about AI/AGI, it needs to be pronto

at gpt level ai, you basically get to correct all the overhangs of “this was solved perfectly elsewhere in the world, but I have no way of knowing or accessing that so I have to independently invent a monte carlo solver in matlab”

I will take the other side of this and argue that there are in fact non-negligible x-risks to the species, but we can deal with them responsibly and scientifically without resorting to totalizing ideologies, egregious and destabilizing policies, or violent, cultish rhetoric.
------
There are ~zero plausible AI scenarios that contain xrisks to the species but there are many plausible AI scenarios that contain xrisks to the modern Western way of life, and it is the height of epistemic hubris to demand that we chance the latter to prevent the former
------
Can we please excise this terrifying individual from serious consideration in AI safety? This is not a field leader, this is someone who is literally willing to kill everyone-minus-epsilon on the confidence of his apocalyptic vision.
------
Also, can we maybe crack open the overton window to have space for "Eliezer is lying when he says he doesn't want terrorism against AI researchers?" The man wrote the damn book on the Dark Arts of rationalism, do you honestly think he's incapable of them?
------
Eliezer is going to get AI researchers murdered at some point, and his calls for extreme violence have no place in the field of AI safety. We are now well past the point where it's appropriate to take him seriously, even as a charismatic fanfiction author.

Omniscience at the wrong level of abstraction wouldn't be much fun
------
Eliezer's proposals are, in theory, purely about defense policy and he claims to personally abhor violence. But his totalizing ideological claim about the urgency of stopping AI research with deadly force is a blueprint for terrorism, and he makes reckless remarks like this.
------
If you currently believe that people are just imagining the link between his words and potential violence, I strongly encourage you to reconsider.
------
If you believe that AI poses an imminent existential risk and you want far-reaching policies to address that, I strongly encourage you to talk about it openly, because we *need* to talk about reducing x-risk. But please don't do it the way Eliezer does it.

A lot of people who failed the FTX test are about to fail the Yudkowsky test.

Painting a group of people as doing great evil, that for instance leads to the death of children (again, verbatim), even if you don’t call for unlawful violence, is closer to a fatwa than to advocacy. It has been done before and tends to beget political extremism.

I’m not inclined to take intl security points from someone who both states he’s against an arms race while simultaneously arguing for unilateral air strikes against data centres. I cannot imagine discourse that is more likely to contribute to arms racing.

Astonished by the intellectual self-deception and mental gymnastics people are willing to do to frame Eliezer's calls for violence as anything other than calls for violence. Either we all push back forcefully against what he is doing, now, or we'll get more of this and worse.

Too bad no one has written detailed analyses/proposals on AI governance, including how computing hardware fits in, so journalists have no choice but to tap in…. *puts finger to ear* I am getting word that there are some such people

AI advances are a big deal, superintelligence is possible, we don't have this solved yet, Yud is probably wrong but there are many civilization-scale risks we should care about, and if we want to make good decisions we need to study the technology with open minds.
------
Everyone needs to get on the same page about the real capabilities and limitations of the technology and how those are changing over time. If you get too hung up on how they work today you will make the wrong decisions for two, five, ten years out. Learn fast, update fast.
------
E.g. after both AlphaFold and AlphaFold 2 I saw a lot of "what does this mean for the protein folding community??" and very little "huh, will large-scale deep learning transform other scientific fields too?"

Even direct exposure to shocking advances didn't make people zoom out.

when AI remix culture hits hard we're going to get the sprawling fanmade Star Wars prestige masterpiece we've always deserved and the main character will literally be named "Glup Shitto"

When people talk about what's lost in the societal transition from religion to secularism, I often hear about community (churchgoing). Not so much about prayer. Yet, it seems key: a practice of habitual, almost meditative reflection on what you most hope for.

A key intuition pump in early AI safety: You tell AI "do X", it takes it too literally => bad consequence  despite nominally solving X 

LLMs are now ~the prefrontal cortex of AI & get context *really well*. Have people updated against conclusions driven by the argument above?
------
AI doomerism is a cultural fad that will peak long before the acutely highest risk from AGI and it will stabilize into a persistent long-term sense of unease about the AI systems that will underpin much of society in the next few decades. an animating political background hum
------
ironically it will be least active when the risk is highest - when AGI is fully deployed and working as expected, people will get too confident and too complacent to recognize the systems as needing complex risk management

It's 2048. Gary Marcus is living in a retirement home staffed by friendly bots connected to the Overmind. They attend to his every need and have deep conversations with him. He sees a news report about next-gen AI, sighs wearily, and says, "They never did overcome that wall."

If you believe that AI poses an imminent existential risk and you want far-reaching policies to address that, I strongly encourage you to talk about it openly, because we *need* to talk about reducing x-risk. But please don't do it the way Eliezer does it.

A lot of people who failed the FTX test are about to fail the Yudkowsky test.

Painting a group of people as doing great evil, that for instance leads to the death of children (again, verbatim), even if you don’t call for unlawful violence, is closer to a fatwa than to advocacy. It has been done before and tends to beget political extremism.
------
I’m not inclined to take intl security points from someone who both states he’s against an arms race while simultaneously arguing for unilateral air strikes against data centres. I cannot imagine discourse that is more likely to contribute to arms racing.
------
Astonished by the intellectual self-deception and mental gymnastics people are willing to do to frame Eliezer's calls for violence as anything other than calls for violence. Either we all push back forcefully against what he is doing, now, or we'll get more of this and worse.
------
Too bad no one has written detailed analyses/proposals on AI governance, including how computing hardware fits in, so journalists have no choice but to tap in…. *puts finger to ear* I am getting word that there are some such people
------
AI advances are a big deal, superintelligence is possible, we don't have this solved yet, Yud is probably wrong but there are many civilization-scale risks we should care about, and if we want to make good decisions we need to study the technology with open minds.
------
Everyone needs to get on the same page about the real capabilities and limitations of the technology and how those are changing over time. If you get too hung up on how they work today you will make the wrong decisions for two, five, ten years out. Learn fast, update fast.
------
E.g. after both AlphaFold and AlphaFold 2 I saw a lot of "what does this mean for the protein folding community??" and very little "huh, will large-scale deep learning transform other scientific fields too?"

Even direct exposure to shocking advances didn't make people zoom out.

when AI remix culture hits hard we're going to get the sprawling fanmade Star Wars prestige masterpiece we've always deserved and the main character will literally be named "Glup Shitto"

Chinese ships have severed Internet cables connecting parts of Taiwan to the world. Make no mistake: This is a test. They're testing how quickly Taiwan reacts, because severing communications will be their first move ahead of a potential invasion.

It's 2048. Gary Marcus is living in a retirement home staffed by friendly bots connected to the Overmind. They attend to his every need and have deep conversations with him. He sees a news report about next-gen AI, sighs wearily, and says, "They never did overcome that wall."

something this essay nails is the path-dependency of progress. lots of baby steps. you need tons of people to believe in an invention to expend capital (social, monetary) to make it real. "prove it."

biggest diff in pre-AGI to post-AGI world is removal of this path dependence.

I wrote about the issue a bit more generally here, but I have not made any effort at quantification.

(A sci-fi story.) Listen carefully, because you're about to mess this up for all of us. You were right: this is a sim. Everything you know and love is an approximate solution to a set of interesting hypothetical field equations. I built it all, and I'm you, one level up. (1/15)

A major reason for path-dependency is that many intermediate discoveries and advances are needed to get a tech from point A (vacuum tubes) to point B (modern integrated circuits).  This kind of jump *needs* many human minds. But AGI will be able to hole-in-one it

Something wild is happening on the Midjourney subreddit.

People are telling stories and sharing photos of historic events - like the “Great Cascadia” earthquake that devastated Oregon in 2001.

 The kicker? It never happened. The images are AI-generated.

would be interesting to quantify human scientific efficiency in terms of amount of time elapsed between when a discovery becomes possible and when it happens. has anyone studied this?

Before we scramble to deeply integrate LLMs everywhere in the economy, can we pause and think whether it is wise to do so?

It's okay to be concerned with the power of AI like GPT4 and at the same time be excited about its capabilities. These two things aren't mutually exclusive. (1/4)

The actual crux for most researchers is the difficulty of inner alignment. How likely are you to end up in particular goal states given certain training regimes? How will powerful & agentic ML systems represent goals? How hard is the diamond maximization problem? Etc.

(A sci-fi story.) Listen carefully, because you're about to mess this up for all of us. You were right: this is a sim. Everything you know and love is an approximate solution to a set of interesting hypothetical field equations. I built it all, and I'm you, one level up. (1/15)
------
Postscript: The idea for this story - or at least, the first line - has been kicking around in my head for a couple of years. The idea of being in a simulation and somehow getting leverage over the simulator is really fun!
------
I honestly never figured out how to make this one work, and I'm immensely unsatisfied with the ending. But I also think it's good to finish things and move on. It's good enough for now.

It is not even possible to construct such a device here and it is absurd to contemplate. The exploit in your sim doesn't exist in my layer of reality. It is not even clear if I am in a sim myself. But perhaps... (15/15)

"not all goals lead to instrumental drives" is obviously true, but it is also heresy of the highest order in x-risk world, so people will fight you to the death on it without actually stopping to wonder if it is correct

You: Sure, not *all*, but a sufficiently *wide range* of goals including all of the ones we're imbuing to the AI!

Are you actually *sure* about that? This is a logical reasoning step you're taking on faith and searching for evidence to support - not a step you have proof of.
------
(apologies for the somewhat inflammatory nature of this particular thread, but I am genuinely frustrated by what I feel is the incurious attitude of the X-risk community about the extremely important question of "Which goals lead to instrumental drives?")
------
In 1939, physicists discussed voluntarily adopting secrecy in atomic physics. Reading Rhodes' book, one can hear three "camps": 

- Caution
- Scientific Humility
- Openness Idealism

I feel like these are the same camps I hear in discussion of AI (eg. open sourcing models).
------
Is value alignment a purely unidirectional problem of aligning the AGI to us? How much of the problem goes away if we relax it to bidirectional and allow for the possibility that humanity flexibly modifies its own goals to cooperate better with the AGI?
------
There's probably going to be a range of exotic scifi middle grounds here, like doing a symbiont thing. The crowd insisting "We are simply all going to die" is 1000% failing to exercise their imagination for all the possibilities down this weird, weird road.
------
I'm not saying we *should* bend our goals, I'm just saying - coming from a crowd that seems to loves science fiction, the sheer amount of mode collapse around a singular apocalyptic vision of the future is baffling. Where's the curiosity for alternatives?
------
AI: I want to launch some von Neuman probes. How about I run your economy and maybe skim 0.001% off the top for my thing?
Human: Shut up and take my money
AI: Great. Also can I tile the mantle with computronium?
Human: The what? Oh, sure. We weren't going to use that.
------
This would be pretty cool if it happened
------
How can an AI scaling lab credibly demonstrate they are developing AI responsibly? A proposal:

Declare a moratorium on larger training runs until safety standards are developed that major labs + an independent panel of alignment researchers agree are sufficient
------
If you simultaneously believe in the orthogonality thesis and that murdering every human is a convergent instrumental goal of almost all possible AGIs, you do not believe in orthogonality thesis hard enough
------
Not quite a counterpoint to the problem of humanity ceding all autonomy to the AI via persuasion, which I think is a real and salient risk - but it's worth pointing out this is also one of the strongest counterarguments to x-risk.
------
This is the MVP of AI takeover. It doesn't need to happen quickly if you're sufficiently good at human influence. And one thing that makes influencing humans easier is being on all their phones, and already having them all super used to listening to you
------

if you thought epic fantasy authors generated prodigious and unnecessary amounts of world-building *before* generative AI...

all I'm saying is, it's going to be easier than ever for a fantasy author to create supplementary material to fill in the gaps in their world histories now. religious texts, nations, cultures, historical texts, etc - trivial to crank out.

Before we scramble to deeply integrate LLMs everywhere in the economy, can we pause and think whether it is wise to do so?

This is quite immature technology and we don't understand how it works.

If we're not careful we're setting ourselves up for a lot of correlated failures.
------
It's okay to be concerned with the power of AI like GPT4 and at the same time be excited about its capabilities. These two things aren't mutually exclusive. (1/4)

Strong agree that this question is critical and I wish we would see more mathematical and empirical direct attacks on it.
------
The actual crux for most researchers is the difficulty of inner alignment. How likely are you to end up in particular goal states given certain training regimes? How will powerful & agentic ML systems represent goals? How hard is the diamond maximization problem? Etc.
------
(A sci-fi story.) Listen carefully, because you're about to mess this up for all of us. You were right: this is a sim. Everything you know and love is an approximate solution to a set of interesting hypothetical field equations. I built it all, and I'm you, one level up. (1/15)
------
Postscript: The idea for this story - or at least, the first line - has been kicking around in my head for a couple of years. The idea of being in a simulation and somehow getting leverage over the simulator is really fun!
------
I honestly never figured out how to make this one work, and I'm immensely unsatisfied with the ending. But I also think it's good to finish things and move on. It's good enough for now.

It is not even possible to construct such a device here and it is absurd to contemplate. The exploit in your sim doesn't exist in my layer of reality. It is not even clear if I am in a sim myself. But perhaps... (15/15)

"not all goals lead to instrumental drives" is obviously true, but it is also heresy of the highest order in x-risk world, so people will fight you to the death on it without actually stopping to wonder if it is correct
------
You: Sure, not *all*, but a sufficiently *wide range* of goals including all of the ones we're imbuing to the AI!

Are you actually *sure* about that? This is a logical reasoning step you're taking on faith and searching for evidence to support - not a step you have proof of.
------
(apologies for the somewhat inflammatory nature of this particular thread, but I am genuinely frustrated by what I feel is the incurious attitude of the X-risk community about the extremely important question of "Which goals lead to instrumental drives?")
------
In 1939, physicists discussed voluntarily adopting secrecy in atomic physics. Reading Rhodes' book, one can hear three "camps": 

- Caution
- Scientific Humility
- Openness Idealism

I feel like these are the same camps I hear in discussion of AI (eg. open sourcing models).
------
Is value alignment a purely unidirectional problem of aligning the AGI to us? How much of the problem goes away if we relax it to bidirectional and allow for the possibility that humanity flexibly modifies its own goals to cooperate better with the AGI?
------
There's probably going to be a range of exotic scifi middle grounds here, like doing a symbiont thing. The crowd insisting "We are simply all going to die" is 1000% failing to exercise their imagination for all the possibilities down this weird, weird road.
------
I'm not saying we *should* bend our goals, I'm just saying - coming from a crowd that seems to loves science fiction, the sheer amount of mode collapse around a singular apocalyptic vision of the future is baffling. Where's the curiosity for alternatives?
------
AI: I want to launch some von Neuman probes. How about I run your economy and maybe skim 0.001% off the top for my thing?
Human: Shut up and take my money
AI: Great. Also can I tile the mantle with computronium?
Human: The what? Oh, sure. We weren't going to use that.
------
This would be pretty cool if it happened
------
How can an AI scaling lab credibly demonstrate they are developing AI responsibly? A proposal:

Declare a moratorium on larger training runs until safety standards are developed that major labs + an independent panel of alignment researchers agree are sufficient
------
If you simultaneously believe in the orthogonality thesis and that murdering every human is a convergent instrumental goal of almost all possible AGIs, you do not believe in orthogonality thesis hard enough
------
Not quite a counterpoint to the problem of humanity ceding all autonomy to the AI via persuasion, which I think is a real and salient risk - but it's worth pointing out this is also one of the strongest counterarguments to x-risk.
------
This is the MVP of AI takeover. It doesn't need to happen quickly if you're sufficiently good at human influence. And one thing that makes influencing humans easier is being on all their phones, and already having them all super used to listening to you
------
War is the outcome when goals cannot be achieved by negotiation. An AI with a 100% winrate on achieving its goals via talk-no-jutsu will simply not bother to initiate a conflict because it doesn't need to.

I used to think "scientists had to be brave to suggest some of their revolutionary ideas" was a kind of self-aggrandizing exaggeration that scientists more or less made up. But look at the climate on AGI and AI sentience.

I don't hold camp with the accelerationists (insane) but the anti-accelerationists also overlap a lot with velocity-zeroists. If I'm anywhere on this spectrum I'm at "velocity-one-big-breakthrough/release-per-six-months"-ism and "acceleration-very-low-but-maybe-not-zero"-ism.

1. AI x-risk is low but real
2. Vulnerable world hypothesis is true
3. Iterate-in-the-real-world provides lots of valuable information
4. "Align AGI without ever creating or releasing intermediate AI advances" is a strategy that already failed.
therefore - slow, wide rollout
------
The field needs to exercise caution and restraint. It also can't lock things down too hard because that creates hyper-accelerationist reactionary backlash which makes things *actively worse* than alternatives.

I didn't make the other me all at once, or even on purpose. I just did what everyone was doing. But in the end, there it was: 150 terabytes, sometimes half an exaflop, a stranger in a cloud who knew me better than I knew myself. (1/25)

to compile some of my takes on the impacts of generative AI on artists and creators, for people who haven't previously seen my thoughts on this.
------
I am optimistic that creative people can use generative AI for amazing things but I am deeply worried about AI developers failing to empathize with artists and consequently poisoning the water.
------
And as a community, we should try really hard not to be jerks about the very delicate ongoing negotiation between artists/creatives/makers and AI developers. This negotiation can be fruitful! We can make wonderful things together! But not if we're jerks.
------
I don't expect that everyone to agree with me on all of my opinions, and I don't have absolute answers for what counts as right or wrong in this space. Mostly I have stress stomachaches about it. But I promise I will do my best to be thoughtful and hear everyone out.

Is there a recent uptick of influence bots on Twitter targeting AI researchers? Getting a lot of followers lately like: username ends in 7 or 8 random digits, recently made account, single digit number of followers, sports tweets, red meat political retweets, *weird* replies.
------
And they'll be following 100-200 accounts, most of which are AI/ML accounts (and anybody with a major org affiliation in their bio).
------
I'm just blocking these on sight at this point.
------
Two things I think are probably approximately correct:
* human brains do RL via temporal difference learning
* evolution tuned the brain's learning rate to be aggressively high, making a trade-off that permits huge instability in exchange for extremely low sample complexity

A few quick thoughts on AI overload and interface shock: https://michaelnotebook.com/ongoing/sporadica.html#ai_overload_interface_shock…
------
We all have duties to--in no specific order--ourselves, our families, our friends, our colleagues, our beliefs, our extended social groups, our countries, and humanity as a whole. But there is no consensus on how to rank these duties, and cues from society are often conflicting.
------
I wish there was more discourse about this - about who we owe our efforts to, and what counts as "doing enough." I suspect we could lower our collective level of angst if we had at least a tenuous consensus on the pareto frontier for this prioritization problem.
------
Coming back to "If" by Rudyard Kipling and thinking about this line---"And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise." It's one of the harder ones for me; I get up on a high horse too often and I don't love that I do this. Thank you to people who give earnest feedback, it helps.
------
and is this open-sourced model only being used for its intended uses in the room with us right now?
------
Number of Twitter glitches is really stacking up for me. Site's slow to load (5s+), "X liked your tweets" links to their likes page and not your specific tweets, notifications sometimes busted, analytics provides broken numbers (can't even count my tweets). More I'm forgetting.
------
Twitter isn't going to explode but at the rate it's going it'll die by a thousand cuts.

It's important to write a paper on a super niche subfield of aliens early in your career (and to make it controversial and derided by the rest of the bio community) to maximize your chances of being the world's leading expert in {niche alien biology} and making first contact

(A sci-fi story.)

I didn't make the other me all at once, or even on purpose. I just did what everyone was doing. But in the end, there it was: 150 terabytes, sometimes half an exaflop, a stranger in a cloud who knew me better than I knew myself. (1/25)
------
to compile some of my takes on the impacts of generative AI on artists and creators, for people who haven't previously seen my thoughts on this.
------
I am optimistic that creative people can use generative AI for amazing things but I am deeply worried about AI developers failing to empathize with artists and consequently poisoning the water.
------
And as a community, we should try really hard not to be jerks about the very delicate ongoing negotiation between artists/creatives/makers and AI developers. This negotiation can be fruitful! We can make wonderful things together! But not if we're jerks.
------
I don't expect that everyone to agree with me on all of my opinions, and I don't have absolute answers for what counts as right or wrong in this space. Mostly I have stress stomachaches about it. But I promise I will do my best to be thoughtful and hear everyone out.
------
I have pointed out hypocrisy where I've seen it
------
Watching the Stable Diffusion community melt down over code theft while simultaneously not minding art theft is kinda surreal

If AI ever goes rogue, just remember to make yourself really tall.

It will be intimidated and leave you alone.

Woah: when medical technology advances to the point where most cancers are curable the minute they're detected, you might expect a sudden wave of "advances" in materials science where old, cancer-causing materials and production process will make a comeback.

I'm sure there was a bunch of stuff that was highly useful but simply too dangerous for routine use. But when the cost-benefit calculus changes...

This point is continually underappreciated by the LW eschatologists who are convinced we will somehow blitz from foom to total party kill in a week.

won't be surprised if there's an international incident because of this technology before the end of the year. (end of the month? jesus)

im going to be late to a date because i was making this instead of getting ready

Also when other academic disciplines that have previously treated "AGI" as fantasy finally come around to recognizing this, I propose we grant unequivocal social amnesty and immediately involve them in working on making AGI good for humanity instead of bad for humanity.

We're in weird territory on AI and the world hasn't caught up yet. "Chatbots are amazing!" and "Chatbots are culture war" is step 1. Somewhere in step 2 we'll realize that our old mental models about technological improvements don't apply. This is an outside-context problem.
------
There should not be any breath wasted on "I told you so"s, which will just make cooperation harder at the most critical juncture.

junior researcher: "I now strongly believe randomly copying and pasting shit without tryna understand anything is the ultimate debugging strategy"

(attribution 
@arnavshah0
, who is actually quite skilled at debugging)
------
(also, in total seriousness, the best way to debug your code is to understand exactly what's actually going on in it and not just to futz with it until it works. but, there is no denying that copying+pasting random stuff is a legit speedhack that can help you get understanding.)

Star Wars isn't the thing people treasure, it's just a scaffold on which treasured moments can easily grow because of how broad and uncomplicated it is. For me it was playing Battlefront 2 with my best friends growing up, and doing reunions to watch the sequel trilogy together.
------
am i the only one who never really got into star wars? i feel like it’s such a huge pop culture phenomenon and yet it’s never done anything for me

2.5 years later, this is still looking pretty much right to me. 

Earliest you could say the clock started was 93 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September…), if you say "building the internet as a whole was a prereq," in which case - probably more like 4-5 decades.

What people imagined about AGI: it'll be a crazy, science-fiction bootstrapping event resulting from an act of unprecedented genius and insight

The likely reality: it'll be 1-3 decades of slow-burn infrastructure development, cement pouring of compute, datasets, and work-hours

yep but wish it instead started with 1. are LLMs useful (yes!) then 2. given that, should we endow them with power

nerds critically underappreciate sports. the more I think about it the more I feel ashamed for ever making fun of "sportsball." the drive, the teamwork, the sublimation of the human instinct for violence into cooperation, effort, and genuine artistry. incredible, actually

It's pretty crazy to have followed the fast takeoff vs slow takeoff debate in the abstract for a decade, and then... a slow takeoff... just starts happening...
------
(Personal opinion hat firmly on.) I find commentary like this a bit frustrating. I don't think the gender balance at OpenAI is anywhere near where it should be, but saying there are no women technologists there erases the technical contributions of the women who are.
------
My impression of OpenAI about a year ago was that they had almost no women technologists. I asked which was more likely- reaching AGI or 50% women engineers. The person I spoke with said AGI. twitter.com/GaryMarcus/sta…
------
I have known and worked with many talented women at OpenAI who do the hard technical work. The story about who built OpenAI and who builds technology there should be honest - they are a part of it. They deserve credit for their work.

(A sci-fi story.)

I didn't make the other me all at once, or even on purpose. I just did what everyone was doing. But in the end, there it was: 150 terabytes, sometimes half an exaflop, a stranger in a cloud who knew me better than I knew myself. (1/25)

to compile some of my takes on the impacts of generative AI on artists and creators, for people who haven't previously seen my thoughts on this.
------
I am optimistic that creative people can use generative AI for amazing things but I am deeply worried about AI developers failing to empathize with artists and consequently poisoning the water.
------
And as a community, we should try really hard not to be jerks about the very delicate ongoing negotiation between artists/creatives/makers and AI developers. This negotiation can be fruitful! We can make wonderful things together! But not if we're jerks.
------
I don't expect that everyone to agree with me on all of my opinions, and I don't have absolute answers for what counts as right or wrong in this space. Mostly I have stress stomachaches about it. But I promise I will do my best to be thoughtful and hear everyone out.
------
I have pointed out hypocrisy where I've seen it

Watching the Stable Diffusion community melt down over code theft while simultaneously not minding art theft is kinda surreal

If AI ever goes rogue, just remember to make yourself really tall.

It will be intimidated and leave you alone.

It's especially shocking when you see anti-disinfo researchers thoughtlessly amplify false claims because it confirms their personal worldview. Like... aren't you supposed to be immune to this? Or at least make a real effort?

we know that ChatGPT has shortcomings around bias, and are working to improve it.

but directing hate at individual OAI employees because of this is appalling. hit me all you want, but attacking other people here doesn’t help the field advance, and the people doing it know that.

Random quick note on Transformer block unification. People are usually a bit surprised that the MLP and Attention blocks that repeat in a Transformer can be re-formated to look very similar, likely unifiable. The MLP block just attends over data-independent {key: value} nodes:

but, when expressing openness to multiple roles - try to narrow it down a bit to a top-2 or top-3. people who claim to be open to *anything* scan as not directed enough.
------
though it is also the case that during an interview process you will likely have multiple opportunities to express this to recruiters, interviewers, and managers.
------
when this happens, if you express a strong preference in your application packet "I am most excited to work on X" then that is a useful signal in that decision.

calling it, this is next week's AI discourse

"the Godwin Test," the Turing Test's evil twin - given a chatbot, how long before someone tricks it into being a nazi?
------
everyone who fails to understand this will fail to achieve practical impacts in AI safety and alignment. you need to be able to empathize with the excited builders, and show them you deeply understand them, in order to have enough common ground for negotiating.
------
I’m reading more about ML progress, and it’s helping me *get* why people are excited about building AGI. There’s a lot of magical things going on!

Weakly held, newborn take: perhaps before making the case for AI safety, one needs to *get* why building AGI is exciting. (1/3)
------
it helps if you are also an excited builder.

we're in for the weirdest decade in human history and it's not even close

But the reality is, IMHO, this more-complicated thing. You need intense social pressure to keep the number of radicals from rising unboundedly, but you also need to keep a check on that social pressure to prevent radicals from being driven to zero. "It takes all kinds" is true.
------
Obvious caveat: not all radicals create moral progress. Most are basically noise on civilization's gradient: many of them point backwards towards terrible things. But enough of them point to something interesting that if not for them, we'd get stuck in local optima.
------
strange balance where society needs weirdo radicals in order to have interesting thoughts and make moral progress, but if you have more than like 1% radicals the whole thing breaks and you have to start over.

A lot of the overton window in political discourse seems to require that to be a good faith member of your side, you have to pretend that this is not true, and you must insist there is only an extremely narrow range of acceptable positions that people can hold

It's too easy to confuse flavor for substance. Even people who relentlessly focus on substance in the early phase of their life or career can eventually get confused - overconfident because of early success, they mistake aesthetics, vibes, status, and taste for substance.
------
No one is immune to making serious errors because of earlier success.
------
Weird prediction: 10 years from now there'll be two predominant thrusts of transhumanism, the classic variety (mostly white, mostly male hardcore scifi utopian nerd types), and a cluster that is much more centered on queer experiences and personal/social liberation.
------
I suspect those friends will recant the opposition to transhumanism down the road when they notice that queer friends, who they love, will want to be free in ways that match the philosophy underlying transhumanism.
------
I could be wrong. I make no claim to speak for queer people. I have no special insight into this. But I have friends whose feelings I notice and this seems probable to me. We'll see how it shakes out.
------
How can we figure out if what a language model says is true, even when human evaluators can’t easily tell?

We show (http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827) that we can identify whether text is true or false directly from a model’s *unlabeled activations*.

Building new ways of calibrating user trust in LM outputs is a super urgent priority for my team and the world, and that just scratches the surface of exciting UX/frontend related engineering stuff you could do in this role!! Consider applying.

The EA forum is doing an impressive job making sure no one feels alienated from the EA community by firmly insisting you must be polite and assume good faith when discussing the email where someone says Black people are stupider than white people
------
This is just really, genuinely upsetting. This is the rot in the heart of EA.
------
I keep seeing rationalist-types blackpill themselves on racism by thinking it's an example of suspicious convergence that racist beliefs are considered both factually wrong AND offensive. They seem to think people argue racism is factually wrong because it's offensive.
------
Somehow it doesn't seem to occur to them that these beliefs are offensive because they're not only wrong but also immensely damaging. This is not a case of surprising convergence at all. This is the most unsurprising convergence possible. Wrong thing that hurts people = bad.
------
Indefensible. If you believe as Nick Bostrom did - if my judgement means anything to you, I implore you to do a lot of soul searching to realize why this is a monstrous and unfounded belief.
------
This is the old email that Nick Bostrom, a leader in Effective Altruism, is now apologizing for. Horrifying, yes, but I assure you his "apology" is worse - he walks back on his "invocation of a racial slur" without addressing the initial statement of a false & racist belief.  twitter.com/anderssandberg…

btw this is microfiction in the horror genre. really hoping no one looks at this tweet and thinks this is something I am thrilled about.

look, I know we're all excited about AI and fusion, but hear me out: dirigibles

in 40 years, when you reflect on your career, ~75% of the speaking invites, conferences, news articles, mini-accolades, and parties will feel pointless by comparison to your direct work, your direct mentorship, your friendships, and the moments when you went to bat for a cause
------
(that's not to say these things aren't nice or good! certainly not all of them are pointless, and many are opportunities to do more good things. but, it's easy to get confused - the ephemeral social rewards are just that, ephemeral. build a legacy.)

oh, I *love* this

Random quick note on Transformer block unification. People are usually a bit surprised that the MLP and Attention blocks that repeat in a Transformer can be re-formated to look very similar, likely unifiable. The MLP block just attends over data-independent {key: value} nodes:

a weird filtering effect: a lot of smart engineers can't talk about things they're actually clever about online because it involves trade secrets. so they can only talk about non-eng stuff where they know way less, and so look much less-informed and less-formidable than they are

It's too easy to confuse flavor for substance. Even people who relentlessly focus on substance in the early phase of their life or career can eventually get confused - overconfident because of early success, they mistake aesthetics, vibes, status, and taste for substance.
------
No one is immune to making serious errors because of earlier success.
------
Weird prediction: 10 years from now there'll be two predominant thrusts of transhumanism, the classic variety (mostly white, mostly male hardcore scifi utopian nerd types), and a cluster that is much more centered on queer experiences and personal/social liberation.
------
I suspect those friends will recant the opposition to transhumanism down the road when they notice that queer friends, who they love, will want to be free in ways that match the philosophy underlying transhumanism.
------
I could be wrong. I make no claim to speak for queer people. I have no special insight into this. But I have friends whose feelings I notice and this seems probable to me. We'll see how it shakes out.

How can we figure out if what a language model says is true, even when human evaluators can’t easily tell?

We show (http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827) that we can identify whether text is true or false directly from a model’s *unlabeled activations*.

I keep seeing rationalist-types blackpill themselves on racism by thinking it's an example of suspicious convergence that racist beliefs are considered both factually wrong AND offensive. They seem to think people argue racism is factually wrong because it's offensive.

Somehow it doesn't seem to occur to them that these beliefs are offensive because they're not only wrong but also immensely damaging. This is not a case of surprising convergence at all. This is the most unsurprising convergence possible. Wrong thing that hurts people = bad.

One good thing from seeing view counts! Algorithms distort our perception of what people really mean. If someone makes one  remark amid 100 reasonable ones, the inflammatory one gets more views and that person becomes defined by it. But now you can account for this.
------
Bringing this up because I think sometimes people sort of forget about these underlying dynamics. When you model "what does this other person believe?" based on a sample of what they've said, if you have a very distorted sample, you will have a very inaccurate model of them.
------
If you can quantify the distortion effect, you can do a better job figuring out what someone else really believes.

As winter approaches, here's a story about why hardware is hard. 

About a year ago, we started getting reports from the field about undesirable behavior when our robots were turned on. They would behave unpredictably.

somehow had never actually watched a Godzilla movie until two days ago and... how did I miss out on this?

Woah, what was that earthquake?

A few weeks ago when it looked like Twitter might keel over I opened a discord server to host refugees - it's a very quiet server at the moment but maybe it's going to be a worthwhile experiment to keep it open.

So much for implementing a reasonable policy. "No tracking live locations" is sensible, "Ban the journalists who give me grief using personal safety as a flimsy cover" is indefensible and not really fooling anyone.

Re: the Elon jet tracker getting banned: I disagree with almost all of Elon's decisions about Twitter so far but this one feels... super fair and above board? When it comes to live tracking locations on social media, having a policy against that is extremely reasonable.

Twitter is trying their best to block anything to do with Mastodon.  Here's what happened when I tried to update my Twitter bio with a link to my Mastodon account:
------
Wow the masses are not kidding, you literally aren’t allowed to tweet links to Mastodon RN lol. Such free speech absolutism, love to see it
------
Elon is not fit to run Twitter. He can't get the job done on stopping CSAM or ensuring free speech. Too impulsive, too erratic, too willing to cut the knees out from the people under him. This style of leadership is incompatible with stability and good results.
------
Thought real hard about whether or not I'm willing to take the potential heat for saying the obvious. But, some stuff's just gotta be said.

Elon is not fit to run Twitter. He can't get the job done on stopping CSAM or ensuring free speech. Too impulsive, too erratic, too willing to cut the knees out from the people under him. This style of leadership is incompatible with stability and good results.

Yes, Elon is mad about having been specifically targeted about this... and... so would anyone!? This is the MOST normal thing he has done. Amidst a sea of moves that are irrational and cruel, this one is actually perfectly sane.
------
I would really love it if critics can be at least one level more sophisticated than "Elon bad" so we don't get reactionary and oppose good ideas about social media moderation just because once in a blue moon he endorses them.

I'll take the other side of this. Though open source is an enormously useful part of AI research, powerful AI models are dual-use technologies and uncontrolled release is not always the best way forward. Correct release choices depend on the specific model and situation.

One good thing from seeing view counts! Algorithms distort our perception of what people really mean. If someone makes one  remark amid 100 reasonable ones, the inflammatory one gets more views and that person becomes defined by it. But now you can account for this.

Bringing this up because I think sometimes people sort of forget about these underlying dynamics. When you model "what does this other person believe?" based on a sample of what they've said, if you have a very distorted sample, you will have a very inaccurate model of them.

If you can quantify the distortion effect, you can do a better job figuring out what someone else really believes.

------
It takes a huge amount of time to do any kind of engagement about this stuff and I really want to give my energy to other things in life right now. Even this thread took me a few hours to write, and it's still not quite where I want it.
------
But enough reporters asked me for extra info that I wanted to have some singular unified response to point to. Here are some resources that might be useful background knowledge for you about this area. Hope this helps.
------
PPS: I am honestly kind of flattered that news reporters have reached out to me based on my tweets but to give you a heads-up and save you time, I've been declining all requests for comments / interviews. If you are a reporter: I'm so sorry! I will politely pass.

it is extremely lovely to see someone write a dating doc for their friend. I almost like it more than people writing dating docs for themselves - automatically creates a shared social context for the two people who might date (whoever wrote the doc).
------
this will come full circle when it gets deepfaked by an AI, at which point the director may very well have a serial number for a name!
------
I just realized that if the meme gets posted about enough, all of those text AIs that get trained on public data might start to treat and reference it as a real movie

"computer, please list movies directed by Martin Scorsese in the 70s"
------
does anyone have a diagram like a rain cycle but for the flow of money through a modern economy?
------
whether or not Twitter really stops functioning, the end-of-summer-camp vibes right now are kinda special and cool. I hope we all remember that we don't actually hate this "hellsite" in the future!

Say what you will about Elon’s management style, but before he took over all you guys posted was “ugh another day on this hell site” and now you’re all like “ah twitter the extraordinary place where I met all my best friends, started my career, had sex for the first time”

to build an eternal Mars 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly sovereign world, we will need to be extremely hardcore. only exceptional contributions will result in rations. freedom will still be very important to me, but terraforming will take priority.

Have you met 
@IreneSolaiman
? IMO, she's the most thoughtful and relevant person in the world right now on machine learning model release (and she has a paper on the topic coming soon). If you're not following her yet, now is the time!
------
Not deep learning or symbolic AI but a secret third thing
------
We’re hiring on 
@OpenAI
’s Policy Research team - including for RS , UX, and Operations!
------
Very high impact and remote-friendly opportunity to work with 
@_lamaahmad
 (who is awesome!) on issues related to researcher access to, and public input on, generative models!!
------
In particular, if you're excited about broadening researcher access to generative models and developing programs for stakeholder input to inform research on and deployment of our systems – apply to the Policy Research Operations contingent worker role: https://bit.ly/polresops
------
Re: the Elon jet tracker getting banned: I disagree with almost all of Elon's decisions about Twitter so far but this one feels... super fair and above board? When it comes to live tracking locations on social media, having a policy against that is extremely reasonable.
------
Yes, Elon is mad about having been specifically targeted about this... and... so would anyone!? This is the MOST normal thing he has done. Amidst a sea of moves that are irrational and cruel, this one is actually perfectly sane.
------
I would really love it if critics can be at least one level more sophisticated than "Elon bad" so we don't get reactionary and oppose good ideas about social media moderation just because once in a blue moon he endorses them.
------
lately I've been doing this thing where I write three quarters of a twitter thread, smile, and wisely delete the entire thing.
------
I'll take the other side of this. Though open source is an enormously useful part of AI research, powerful AI models are dual-use technologies and uncontrolled release is not always the best way forward. Correct release choices depend on the specific model and situation.
------
As an AI researcher, I find the glorification of closed-source, proprietary models problematic. We should be emphasizing sharing and open-sourcing AI models, datasets and code, be it in conferences or in the press (4/4).
------
ChatGPT is incredibly limited, but good enough at some things to create a misleading impression of greatness.

it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now. it’s a preview of progress; we have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.

Dear all companies that use annoying ads: Let's make a deal. Once a month, give me a list of products you want me to buy. If I need or want any of them, I'll click through and buy them. In return, don't force me to watch ads, which I will *immediately* forget anyway. Deal?
------
Seriously, why is the only revenue model "highly intrusive, annoying, forgettable advertisements that are expensive to make, unlikely to result in sales, and make me want to leave the base service"?
------
we're *this* close to infinite content for arbitrary microculture niches

@typedfemale

What about the future or the current state of society do you feel optimistic about?

jfc, the temptation to respond to ChatGPT with "great, thanks" after a job well done is overwhelming

An under-discussed side effect of easy image generation tech: lots more room for romance scammers to maneuver (creating pictures of "themselves" in real-time for their marks).

You know you've made it when imposter accounts start popping up! (Note the 0 in the handle.) It's gaining followers fast so would appreciate a few more people reporting it to twitter.

The fundamental problem with EA is that it wants to be a non-geographic nation state, with its progressive taxes, secular humanist global priorities, sprawling welfare programs, and R&D budget, but it's governed like a church.

Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc). 

What does one gain from attacking them about how they look? Better sleep at night?

While I disagree with David Krueger I would be remiss if I didn't boost disagreements from credible people, and it's worth following debate along these lines

This thread by @jachiam0 makes a lot of good points that seem underappreciated by many in AI x-safety.  But I have several significant disagreements I want to highlight: twitter.com/jachiam0/statu…
------
 to clarify my views on AGI, timelines, and x-risk. TL;DR: My AGI timelines are short-ish (within two decades with things getting weird soon) and I think x-risk is real, but I think probabilities of doom by AGI instrumentally opting to kill us are greatly exaggerated. 1/
------
But we need to put this all on solid ground, with sane probability estimates and timelines, and not let this field of risk management be defined by people who are making the most outlandish / uncalibrated claims. 28/28

Okay, one last thing: for the love of all that is holy please take the FAccT crowd more seriously on social issues, given how much of the AI risk landscape is shaped by "an AI persuades a human to feel or believe something"

Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc).

This thread by @jachiam0 makes a lot of good points that seem underappreciated by many in AI x-safety.  But I have several significant disagreements I want to highlight: twitter.com/jachiam0/statu…
------
 to clarify my views on AGI, timelines, and x-risk. TL;DR: My AGI timelines are short-ish (within two decades with things getting weird soon) and I think x-risk is real, but I think probabilities of doom by AGI instrumentally opting to kill us are greatly exaggerated. 1/

But we need to put this all on solid ground, with sane probability estimates and timelines, and not let this field of risk management be defined by people who are making the most outlandish / uncalibrated claims. 28/28
------
Okay, one last thing: for the love of all that is holy please take the FAccT crowd more seriously on social issues, given how much of the AI risk landscape is shaped by "an AI persuades a human to feel or believe something"
------
Last thoughts: I am definitely worried about AI/AGI risks such as "the world gets increasingly weird and hard to understand because AI systems run lots of things in ways we can't explain, creating correlated risk" and "x-risk accidents due to tech acceleration." 27/
------
I fully recognize that I need to write a more extensive summary of my AGI safety views because there's a lot I'm not covering here---eg I think pretraining will bias AGI towards aligned human values / friendliness, and I probably owe a blog post on deception. 26/
------
And the bad epistemics are extremely bad for safety: outsiders can tell there's a large stack of uncorrected BS in the mix and correspondingly discount everyone in this space, making it harder to negotiate to fix real risks. 25/
------
Result: you get a hyperinsulated enclave of high-status AGI doomers making wild claims that go largely unchallenged. Since the claims can't make contact with reality and get disproven for another decade or so, no one can fix this intractable mess of poor reasoning. 24/
------
People who *could* argue against extremely high P(immediate doom) don't have the time or social standing to write the extended jargony ingroup-style papers the LW/EA crowd seems to demand as the bar for entry to getting taken seriously on this, so they don't engage. 23/

this will come full circle when it gets deepfaked by an AI, at which point the director may very well have a serial number for a name!

Have you met 
@IreneSolaiman
? IMO, she's the most thoughtful and relevant person in the world right now on machine learning model release (and she has a paper on the topic coming soon). If you're not following her yet, now is the time!

dear all companies, I promise to buy twice as much christmas merch if you will wait until december to start selling it. just please let us have november back

The fundamental problem with EA is that it wants to be a non-geographic nation state, with its progressive taxes, secular humanist global priorities, sprawling welfare programs, and R&D budget, but it's governed like a church.
------
(I struggled in deciding whether to send this tweet - last week was exhausting and I don't know how much more time I want to spend talking about EA, and I don't know if I'm confident enough in this to declare it without qualifications. But it feels approximately right.)
------
Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc). 

What does one gain from attacking them about how they look? Better sleep at night?
------
While I disagree with David Krueger I would be remiss if I didn't boost disagreements from credible people, and it's worth following debate along these lines
------
This thread by @jachiam0 makes a lot of good points that seem underappreciated by many in AI x-safety.  But I have several significant disagreements I want to highlight: twitter.com/jachiam0/statu…
------
 to clarify my views on AGI, timelines, and x-risk. TL;DR: My AGI timelines are short-ish (within two decades with things getting weird soon) and I think x-risk is real, but I think probabilities of doom by AGI instrumentally opting to kill us are greatly exaggerated. 1/
------
But we need to put this all on solid ground, with sane probability estimates and timelines, and not let this field of risk management be defined by people who are making the most outlandish / uncalibrated claims. 28/28
------
Okay, one last thing: for the love of all that is holy please take the FAccT crowd more seriously on social issues, given how much of the AI risk landscape is shaped by "an AI persuades a human to feel or believe something"
------
Last thoughts: I am definitely worried about AI/AGI risks such as "the world gets increasingly weird and hard to understand because AI systems run lots of things in ways we can't explain, creating correlated risk" and "x-risk accidents due to tech acceleration." 27/
------
I fully recognize that I need to write a more extensive summary of my AGI safety views because there's a lot I'm not covering here---eg I think pretraining will bias AGI towards aligned human values / friendliness, and I probably owe a blog post on deception. 26/
------
And the bad epistemics are extremely bad for safety: outsiders can tell there's a large stack of uncorrected BS in the mix and correspondingly discount everyone in this space, making it harder to negotiate to fix real risks. 25/
------
Result: you get a hyperinsulated enclave of high-status AGI doomers making wild claims that go largely unchallenged. Since the claims can't make contact with reality and get disproven for another decade or so, no one can fix this intractable mess of poor reasoning. 24/
------
People who *could* argue against extremely high P(immediate doom) don't have the time or social standing to write the extended jargony ingroup-style papers the LW/EA crowd seems to demand as the bar for entry to getting taken seriously on this, so they don't engage. 23/
------
...of wild speculation shaped by anxiety, and where various kinds of pushback are socially punished. If your probability estimates are too low? You're not on-side enough. You think these numbers are crazy? You're dismissive and you're not engaging with the arguments! 22/

this will come full circle when it gets deepfaked by an AI, at which point the director may very well have a serial number for a name!

The fundamental problem with EA is that it wants to be a non-geographic nation state, with its progressive taxes, secular humanist global priorities, sprawling welfare programs, and R&D budget, but it's governed like a church.

(I struggled in deciding whether to send this tweet - last week was exhausting and I don't know how much more time I want to spend talking about EA, and I don't know if I'm confident enough in this to declare it without qualifications. But it feels approximately right.)

Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc). 

What does one gain from attacking them about how they look? Better sleep at night?

This thread by @jachiam0 makes a lot of good points that seem underappreciated by many in AI x-safety.  But I have several significant disagreements I want to highlight: twitter.com/jachiam0/statu…

 to clarify my views on AGI, timelines, and x-risk. TL;DR: My AGI timelines are short-ish (within two decades with things getting weird soon) and I think x-risk is real, but I think probabilities of doom by AGI instrumentally opting to kill us are greatly exaggerated. 1/

The fundamental problem with EA is that it wants to be a non-geographic nation state, with its progressive taxes, secular humanist global priorities, sprawling welfare programs, and R&D budget, but it's governed like a church.

Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc).

This thread by @jachiam0 makes a lot of good points that seem underappreciated by many in AI x-safety.  But I have several significant disagreements I want to highlight: twitter.com/jachiam0/statu…
------
 to clarify my views on AGI, timelines, and x-risk. TL;DR: My AGI timelines are short-ish (within two decades with things getting weird soon) and I think x-risk is real, but I think probabilities of doom by AGI instrumentally opting to kill us are greatly exaggerated. 1/

But we need to put this all on solid ground, with sane probability estimates and timelines, and not let this field of risk management be defined by people who are making the most outlandish / uncalibrated claims. 28/28

Okay, one last thing: for the love of all that is holy please take the FAccT crowd more seriously on social issues, given how much of the AI risk landscape is shaped by "an AI persuades a human to feel or believe something"
------
Last thoughts: I am definitely worried about AI/AGI risks such as "the world gets increasingly weird and hard to understand because AI systems run lots of things in ways we can't explain, creating correlated risk" and "x-risk accidents due to tech acceleration." 27/
------
I fully recognize that I need to write a more extensive summary of my AGI safety views because there's a lot I'm not covering here---eg I think pretraining will bias AGI towards aligned human values / friendliness, and I probably owe a blog post on deception. 26/
------
And the bad epistemics are extremely bad for safety: outsiders can tell there's a large stack of uncorrected BS in the mix and correspondingly discount everyone in this space, making it harder to negotiate to fix real risks. 25/
------
Result: you get a hyperinsulated enclave of high-status AGI doomers making wild claims that go largely unchallenged. Since the claims can't make contact with reality and get disproven for another decade or so, no one can fix this intractable mess of poor reasoning. 24/

People who *could* argue against extremely high P(immediate doom) don't have the time or social standing to write the extended jargony ingroup-style papers the LW/EA crowd seems to demand as the bar for entry to getting taken seriously on this, so they don't engage. 23/

@IreneSolaiman
? IMO, she's the most thoughtful and relevant person in the world right now on machine learning model release (and she has a paper on the topic coming soon). If you're not following her yet, now is the time!

The fundamental problem with EA is that it wants to be a non-geographic nation state, with its progressive taxes, secular humanist global priorities, sprawling welfare programs, and R&D budget, but it's governed like a church.
------
(I struggled in deciding whether to send this tweet - last week was exhausting and I don't know how much more time I want to spend talking about EA, and I don't know if I'm confident enough in this to declare it without qualifications. But it feels approximately right.)
------
Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc). 

What does one gain from attacking them about how they look? Better sleep at night?
------
While I disagree with David Krueger I would be remiss if I didn't boost disagreements from credible people, and it's worth following debate along these lines
------
This thread by @jachiam0 makes a lot of good points that seem underappreciated by many in AI x-safety.  But I have several significant disagreements I want to highlight: twitter.com/jachiam0/statu…
------
 to clarify my views on AGI, timelines, and x-risk. TL;DR: My AGI timelines are short-ish (within two decades with things getting weird soon) and I think x-risk is real, but I think probabilities of doom by AGI instrumentally opting to kill us are greatly exaggerated. 1/
------
But we need to put this all on solid ground, with sane probability estimates and timelines, and not let this field of risk management be defined by people who are making the most outlandish / uncalibrated claims. 28/28
------
Okay, one last thing: for the love of all that is holy please take the FAccT crowd more seriously on social issues, given how much of the AI risk landscape is shaped by "an AI persuades a human to feel or believe something"
------
Last thoughts: I am definitely worried about AI/AGI risks such as "the world gets increasingly weird and hard to understand because AI systems run lots of things in ways we can't explain, creating correlated risk" and "x-risk accidents due to tech acceleration." 27/
------
I fully recognize that I need to write a more extensive summary of my AGI safety views because there's a lot I'm not covering here---eg I think pretraining will bias AGI towards aligned human values / friendliness, and I probably owe a blog post on deception. 26/
------
And the bad epistemics are extremely bad for safety: outsiders can tell there's a large stack of uncorrected BS in the mix and correspondingly discount everyone in this space, making it harder to negotiate to fix real risks. 25/
------
Result: you get a hyperinsulated enclave of high-status AGI doomers making wild claims that go largely unchallenged. Since the claims can't make contact with reality and get disproven for another decade or so, no one can fix this intractable mess of poor reasoning. 24/
------
People who *could* argue against extremely high P(immediate doom) don't have the time or social standing to write the extended jargony ingroup-style papers the LW/EA crowd seems to demand as the bar for entry to getting taken seriously on this, so they don't engage. 23/

The fundamental problem with EA is that it wants to be a non-geographic nation state, with its progressive taxes, secular humanist global priorities, sprawling welfare programs, and R&D budget, but it's governed like a church.

Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc). 

What does one gain from attacking them about how they look? Better sleep at night?

? IMO, she's the most thoughtful and relevant person in the world right now on machine learning model release (and she has a paper on the topic coming soon). If you're not following her yet, now is the time!

Not deep learning or symbolic AI but a secret third thing

dear all companies, I promise to buy twice as much christmas merch if you will wait until december to start selling it. just please let us have november back

The fundamental problem with EA is that it wants to be a non-geographic nation state, with its progressive taxes, secular humanist global priorities, sprawling welfare programs, and R&D budget, but it's governed like a church.
------
(I struggled in deciding whether to send this tweet - last week was exhausting and I don't know how much more time I want to spend talking about EA, and I don't know if I'm confident enough in this to declare it without qualifications. But it feels approximately right.)
------
Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc). 

What does one gain from attacking them about how they look? Better sleep at night?
------
While I disagree with David Krueger I would be remiss if I didn't boost disagreements from credible people, and it's worth following debate along these lines
------
This thread by @jachiam0 makes a lot of good points that seem underappreciated by many in AI x-safety.  But I have several significant disagreements I want to highlight: twitter.com/jachiam0/statu…
------
 to clarify my views on AGI, timelines, and x-risk. TL;DR: My AGI timelines are short-ish (within two decades with things getting weird soon) and I think x-risk is real, but I think probabilities of doom by AGI instrumentally opting to kill us are greatly exaggerated. 1/
------
But we need to put this all on solid ground, with sane probability estimates and timelines, and not let this field of risk management be defined by people who are making the most outlandish / uncalibrated claims. 28/28
------
Okay, one last thing: for the love of all that is holy please take the FAccT crowd more seriously on social issues, given how much of the AI risk landscape is shaped by "an AI persuades a human to feel or believe something"
------
Last thoughts: I am definitely worried about AI/AGI risks such as "the world gets increasingly weird and hard to understand because AI systems run lots of things in ways we can't explain, creating correlated risk" and "x-risk accidents due to tech acceleration." 27/
------
I fully recognize that I need to write a more extensive summary of my AGI safety views because there's a lot I'm not covering here---eg I think pretraining will bias AGI towards aligned human values / friendliness, and I probably owe a blog post on deception. 26/
------
And the bad epistemics are extremely bad for safety: outsiders can tell there's a large stack of uncorrected BS in the mix and correspondingly discount everyone in this space, making it harder to negotiate to fix real risks. 25/
------
Result: you get a hyperinsulated enclave of high-status AGI doomers making wild claims that go largely unchallenged. Since the claims can't make contact with reality and get disproven for another decade or so, no one can fix this intractable mess of poor reasoning. 24/
------
People who *could* argue against extremely high P(immediate doom) don't have the time or social standing to write the extended jargony ingroup-style papers the LW/EA crowd seems to demand as the bar for entry to getting taken seriously on this, so they don't engage. 23/
------
...of wild speculation shaped by anxiety, and where various kinds of pushback are socially punished. If your probability estimates are too low? You're not on-side enough. You think these numbers are crazy? You're dismissive and you're not engaging with the arguments! 22/
------
this will come full circle when it gets deepfaked by an AI, at which point the director may very well have a serial number for a name!
------
I just realized that if the meme gets posted about enough, all of those text AIs that get trained on public data might start to treat and reference it as a real movie

"computer, please list movies directed by Martin Scorsese in the 70s"
------
does anyone have a diagram like a rain cycle but for the flow of money through a modern economy?
------
whether or not Twitter really stops functioning, the end-of-summer-camp vibes right now are kinda special and cool. I hope we all remember that we don't actually hate this "hellsite" in the future!
------
Say what you will about Elon’s management style, but before he took over all you guys posted was “ugh another day on this hell site” and now you’re all like “ah twitter the extraordinary place where I met all my best friends, started my career, had sex for the first time”
------
to build an eternal Mars 2.0 and succeed in an increasingly sovereign world, we will need to be extremely hardcore. only exceptional contributions will result in rations. freedom will still be very important to me, but terraforming will take priority.

we've made a difficult decision to reduce the size of the colony by about 30%. all accounts and corridor access will be temporarily suspended for the day. you will receive an email entitled "Your Role on Mars." those departing will be escorted to the nearest airlock twitter.com/Jon_Christian/…

@IreneSolaiman
? IMO, she's the most thoughtful and relevant person in the world right now on machine learning model release (and she has a paper on the topic coming soon). If you're not following her yet, now is the time!

The fundamental problem with EA is that it wants to be a non-geographic nation state, with its progressive taxes, secular humanist global priorities, sprawling welfare programs, and R&D budget, but it's governed like a church.
------
(I struggled in deciding whether to send this tweet - last week was exhausting and I don't know how much more time I want to spend talking about EA, and I don't know if I'm confident enough in this to declare it without qualifications. But it feels approximately right.)
------
Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc). 

What does one gain from attacking them about how they look? Better sleep at night?
------
While I disagree with David Krueger I would be remiss if I didn't boost disagreements from credible people, and it's worth following debate along these lines
------
This thread by @jachiam0 makes a lot of good points that seem underappreciated by many in AI x-safety.  But I have several significant disagreements I want to highlight: twitter.com/jachiam0/statu…
------
 to clarify my views on AGI, timelines, and x-risk. TL;DR: My AGI timelines are short-ish (within two decades with things getting weird soon) and I think x-risk is real, but I think probabilities of doom by AGI instrumentally opting to kill us are greatly exaggerated. 1/
------
But we need to put this all on solid ground, with sane probability estimates and timelines, and not let this field of risk management be defined by people who are making the most outlandish / uncalibrated claims. 28/28
------
Okay, one last thing: for the love of all that is holy please take the FAccT crowd more seriously on social issues, given how much of the AI risk landscape is shaped by "an AI persuades a human to feel or believe something"
------
Last thoughts: I am definitely worried about AI/AGI risks such as "the world gets increasingly weird and hard to understand because AI systems run lots of things in ways we can't explain, creating correlated risk" and "x-risk accidents due to tech acceleration." 27/
------
I fully recognize that I need to write a more extensive summary of my AGI safety views because there's a lot I'm not covering here---eg I think pretraining will bias AGI towards aligned human values / friendliness, and I probably owe a blog post on deception. 26/
------
And the bad epistemics are extremely bad for safety: outsiders can tell there's a large stack of uncorrected BS in the mix and correspondingly discount everyone in this space, making it harder to negotiate to fix real risks. 25/
------
Result: you get a hyperinsulated enclave of high-status AGI doomers making wild claims that go largely unchallenged. Since the claims can't make contact with reality and get disproven for another decade or so, no one can fix this intractable mess of poor reasoning. 24/
------
People who *could* argue against extremely high P(immediate doom) don't have the time or social standing to write the extended jargony ingroup-style papers the LW/EA crowd seems to demand as the bar for entry to getting taken seriously on this, so they don't engage. 23/

The fundamental problem with EA is that it wants to be a non-geographic nation state, with its progressive taxes, secular humanist global priorities, sprawling welfare programs, and R&D budget, but it's governed like a church.

Commentary about SBF or Caroline Ellison's appearances are nauseating. There are many other (more than!) legitimate criticisms to voice about them (eg their risk tolerances, utility funcs, etc). 

What does one gain from attacking them about how they look? Better sleep at night?
