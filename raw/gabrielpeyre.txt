A nice mathematical puzzle

If you take a 4-norm ball and cut it carefully, you will find a two-norm ball. 3D printed visual evidence below.
The puzzle: Why does this happen and how much more generally does it happen?

A joint distribution encodes the dependencies between its two marginal distributions (here in the simple case of a density with respect to a product of measures). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution…
------
Fun (...) fact: the figure was generated backwards: from fX and fY, the joint distribution f is computed as the solution of an entropic regularized Optimal Transport (aka Schrodinger's problem).
------
A much simpler approach (but less pleasing visually) would be to take f(x,y)=fX(x)fY(y) (corresponding to the limit of infinite entropic regularization, ie infinite temperature of the gaz for Schrodinger, or independent random variables for probabilists).

@adad8m
 found a counter example. But if instead I look for *squared* Euclidean distances, i.e.  |xi-xj|_p=|zi-zj|_2^2 it seems to be possible. You are welcome to try my code to see if you can find counter examples.

Here phi'_inf is the limit of phi(x)/x as x grows. So if phi grows faster than linear functions (eg x*log(x)) then phi'_inf=+inf, the divergence is +inf is alpha does not have a density with respect to beta (in the discrete case, if beta is 0 then alpha must also be 0).
