Speculative execution for LLMs is an excellent inference-time optimization.

It hinges on the following unintuitive observation: forwarding an LLM on a single input token takes about as much time as forwarding an LLM on K input tokens in a batch (for larger K than you might… Show more

Deep Neural Nets: 33 years ago and 33 years from now
https://karpathy.github.io/2022/03/14/lecun1989/…

My post from last year randomly made it to HN so resharing here too. Maybe in 2055 someone will train an improved GPT-4 on their personal computing device in ~1 min as an irrelevant fun weekend project.

Looks very nice on initial skim!
But about this "Unnatural Code Llama"...

Today we’re releasing Code Llama, a large language model built on top of Llama 2, fine-tuned for coding & state-of-the-art for publicly available coding tools.

Keeping with our open approach, Code Llama is publicly-available now for both research & commercial use.

Open challenges in LLM research

The first two challenges, hallucinations and context learning, are probably the most talked about today.

I’m the most excited about 3 (multimodality), 5 (new architecture), and 6 (GPU alternatives).

Number 5 and number 6, new architectures and… Show more

https://finbarr.ca/how-is-llama-cpp-possible/…

llama.cpp surprised many people (myself included) with how quickly you can run large LLMs on small computers, e.g. 7B runs @ ~16 tok/s on a MacBook. Wait don't you need supercomputers to work… Show more

Two notes I wanted to add:

1) In addition to parallel inference and training, prompt encoding is also parallelizable even at batch_size=1 because the prompt tokens can be encoded by the LLM in parallel instead of decoded serially one by one. The token inputs into LLMs always… Show more

We’ve been waiting for this moment and now we can share it with you: Today, we received our paid driverless permit from the CPUC! In the coming weeks, we’ll begin charging fares for rider-only trips and welcoming new riders into Waymo One in San Francisco. https://waymo.com/blog/2023/08/waymos-next-chapter-in-san-francisco.html…
